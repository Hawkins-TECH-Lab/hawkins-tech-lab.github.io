Can talk about axioms in math from book on Certainty to Uncertainty...

Sir Richard Stone (1913-91) some called the 'father of national income accounting' was leary of monetizing houehold labour when assessing it through the UN SNA reports. Thought it would be impossible to know how to do it because of lack of dat, and also social awkwardness of such a study. 70+ years on, there remains little theory that explains why homemakers should not be included in GDP. SNA developers have devised a different defence because although equivalent to work done by servants "by convention... only the wages of the domestic staff are treated as the value of output". Invoke common sense and isolation from the market, difficulty of making economical estimation of the value of these activities. Awkward logic of GDP going up if we looked after each others children (see other places). Despite this apparent inability to value home production, the home itself is included in GDP accounts. In the United States, such 'work' amounts to 6 per cent of GDP even though none of this work exists. It is simply payment of rents from the home owners to themselves as a measure of capital gains. Argument made is that there would be a distortion in international and inter-temporal comparisons of production and consumption if housing services were ignored in the GDP accounts. The example would be Switzerland (high rent rate) having a higher GDP than the US (high ownership rate) due to the difference in these rates. Rent seeking is also an issue - increasing the rent increases the value produced by real estate sector but what if the quality of rental services does not see a corresponding improvement? New York and London tenants as example know too well the impact of rising real estate markets but no change in quality for them as tenants. We will consider this topic further in Chapter 3 through our discussion of the thermodynamic basis of the economy. 

There is a mythical substructure to our "social sciences" - what appear as unassailable axioms, the stable points around which our self-knowledge is organized, are scattering like mice. Myth in itself is not a problem. Just as all societies have their science, all societies have their myths. Myth is the way in which human societies give structure and meaning to experience. But the larger mythic structures of history we've been deploying for the last several centuries simply don't work any more; they are impossible to reconcile with the evidence now before our eyes... Max Planck once remarked that new scientific truths don't replace old ones by convincing established scientists that they were wrong; they do so because proponents of the older theory eventually die, and generations that follow find the new truths and theories to be familiar, obvious even.


Western Critiques of Western Research As discussed in the previous chapter, the Western cultural archive con tained within it several traditions of knowledge and rules of practice for engaging in debates over knowledge. These rules enabled systems or methods of self-critique. The notion of research as an objective, value fr ee and scientific process for observing and making sense of human realities is taken for granted by many social scientists. Philosophers of science refer to this attitude as 'positivism'. Differences in approach to research, however, have been the subject of continuous debate, as those engaged in attempts to understand human society grapple with the problematic nature of social science inquiry. Within the social sciences there have been a number of disputes over method, meanings and what constitutes 'good' research. Method is important because it is regarded as the way in which knowledge is acquired or discovered and as a way in which we can 'know' what is real. Each academic discipline is attached not just to a set of ideas about knowledge, but also to methodologies. Disputes over method occur both within disciplines and across disciplines. This is not surprising, considering that all academic disciplines, as defined by the West, are derived from shared philo sophical foundations. Some disputes, however, have 'raged' within the scientific world and have contributed to major schisms in theoretical positions.2 At one level, this debate has been concerned primarily with issues related to methodolo and method. These issues focus u on the appropriateness of research design and analysis. Definitions of validity · · m� t ro construct and perfect scientific instruments or o servrng an exp a1n111g human behaviour and the human condition. At a broader level, however, the debate has been concerned with the wider aims and role of research. Social science fields of inquiry are dependent on the way society is viewed, and the body of knowledge which legitimates that viewpoint. The dispute at this level is over the validity of scientific methods within the positivist paradigm, and whether this is an appropriate paradigm for understanding human society. - Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples is a book by New Zealand academic Linda Tuhiwai Smith.

A distinction must be made between laws of nature and laws of social behaviour. First, we can note that laws of nature are immutable but constantly evolving. Gravity is a law of nature defined by mathematical terms developed by Newton but expanded upon and refined by Einstein. Laws of social behaviour, such as those defined by economics, are by their nature constructs of a particular social (i.e., moral) system. For illustration, let us consider the consumption of goods central to microeconomic analysis. The classical economic calculus says that a good has a monetary price, which an individual considers subject to a constraint imposed by their income. Their goal is to maximize the utility of goods consumption subject to this income constraint. We will return to this fundamental example many times through this book. However, for the moment let us begin by examining the assumptions of this statement. First, do all goods have a monetary price? Certainly not! I can take a tree branch and transform it into a walking staff, fence post, or any number of other useful goods without any expenditure of money. Until the last 300 years, most households produced the majority of their own goods and services outside the economic market. I recall submitting a grant proposal on consumption subject to natural resource constraints. The response from reviewers was that individuals do not consumer resources when making consumption decisions, as though this behaviour were an immutable feature of human decision-making and not a feature of the prevailing social system being prefaced on monetary markets. As noted above, for most of human history resource considerations were the prevailing constraint on consumption as goods could not be shipped over long distances at low cost. Within the blip of human existence on earth, the centring of income constrained consumption is a sub-blip of inperceivable duration. Not a fundamental law of nature - just a social construct that may be altered through moral training. As stated by Graeber and Wengrow, "in developing the scientific means to know our own past, we have exposed the mythical substructure of our 'social science' - what once appeared unassailable axioms, the stable points around which self-knowledge is organized, are scattering like mice". What then is the purpose of new knowledge (or re-discover old knowledge), if not to create new and (or re-create) different forms of social reality?

Myth in itself is not the problem here. It shouldn't be mistaken for bad or infantile science. Just as all societies have their science, all societies have their myth. Myth is the way in which human societies give structure and meaning to experience. But the larger mythic structures of history we've been deploying for the last several centuries simply don't work any more; they are impossible to reconcile with the evidence now before our eyes, the structures and meanings they encourage are tawdry, shop-worn, and politically disastrous... Max Planck once remarked that new scientific truths don't replace old ones by convincing established scientist that they were wrong they do so because proponents of the older theory eventually die, and generations that follow find the new truths and theories to be familiar, obvious even."
