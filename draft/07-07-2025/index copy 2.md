# Defining Complex Civilization
Joseph Tainter defines collapse as "a rapid, significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity". This definition relies on a society maintaining a level of complexity over generations and the loss must be rapid (over a few decades). It is a complex process to define and identify in history. Consider the case of Rome, which declined over a period of a few decades but also saw a shift to the east (Rome to Constantinople). One could argue that Rome did not collapse; rather, it simply declined and shifted its center of gravity.

Likewise, Tainter defines civilizational complexity based on its size, hierarchy, and complex. Luke Kemp in "Goliath's Curse" and David Graeber/Wengrow in "The Dawn of Everything" make counter arguments that hierarchy is a function of dominance and is not necessary for complex civilization. My view is somewhere in the middle. Current civilization, as documnented by Thomas Piketty in "Capital in the 21st Century", is too hierarchical and uneven. However, there is a need for hierarchy and heterogeneity in that individuals must necesessary hold different roles that lead to stratification and hierarchy - I advise graduate students and teach undergraduate students; the Prime Minister is the leader of Canada; and income should increase with experience and responsibility (though not as steeply as in many settings).

Another dimension of complexity is attributed to Robert Boyd, as discussed in "A Different Kind of Animal". Boyd describes the human ability to weigh imitation and environmental responses. Imitation is the copying of social patterns across generations, which Boyd frames around culture as an evolutionary force. Environmental response is the adaptation by individuals to current conditions. If individuals rely more heavily on imitation, the population will track environmental change less closely. In the face of climate change, I argue that there is a need to re-evaluate this balance, shifting it increasingly towards adaptation to environmental responses rather than imitation of the cultural norms we inherited from previous generations. Conversely, I agree with Boyd that the collective brainpower enabled by our propensity for imitation means that culture allows large populations of humans to acquire and pool local adaptations to invent solutions to global challenges. Paraphrasing the words of the ecologist E.O. Wilson, the problem we must solve is how to align our paleolithic emotions and imitation of millions of generations of ancestors with the speed of environmental change induced by our god-like technology, given the signals and structures provided by our medieval institutions.

# Measuring Civilizational Progress

Ian Morris defines a measure of social progress based on energy capture, organizational capacity, information processing capability, and military power. The choice of metrics is strongly influenced by one's worldview and definition of progress. We can reference the work of XXX on the limitations of ordered quantification.... Energy capture begins from a value statement that can be connected to Howard T. Odum's definition of the maximimum power principle - that systems seek out the maximum power (i.e., input energy per unit time) and not necessary the maximum efficiency alternative. The unspoken assumption is that energy capture (and therefore consumption) is an objective good. Information processing capabability is measured based on written communcation. Of course, some civilizations (notably the Incan use of quipu, or knotted strings, for recording keeping) had no formal system of writing to represent abstract concepts.

We respond to what we measure. While the Morris Score of Social Development is a useful framework for tracking change over time, it is firmly rooted in a Western value system. In the same way that Kate Raworth, in "Doughnut Economics", critiques the reliance on GDP growth as a measure of progress or decline, civilizational metrics are prone to definitional bias. Collapse as measured by Morris' social development or Kuznets' GDP are simply one a slice of civilizational status that obfuscates all complexity. If we change our metrics, collapse may represent a reorientation in response to constraints imposed by environmental or social forces. I will expand on this theme in the following two sections.

# Energy capture and the carbon pulse - include images.
Our current fossil fuel-based energy system is a marvel... shift from human and flow-based energy to stock-based energy. A stock is by its nature finite and depletable. In Fossil Capital, Andreas Malm makes the argument that energy capture transitioned during the Industrial Revolution from flow-based (i.e., water and wind) to stock-based (i.e., fossil fuels) energy. Flow-based energy is constrained in its location by access to waterways, whereas stock-based energy may be moved and accumulated as a stock. This feature gives rise to the capitalist capture of the means of production (i.e, fossil fuels).

The carbon pulse concept has parallels to the energy capture component of Morris' social development metric.
