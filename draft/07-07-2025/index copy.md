# Context

-	Ontology concerns what exists and the nature of reality. If you are saying that revealed preference theory is flawed because it assumes a world in which individuals are free, unconstrained agents (when in reality, structural forces like inequality, institutions, or power relations exist and shape choices), then you are making an ontological critique. The issue is about the mismatch between the assumed reality (free choice) and the actual reality (constrained choice).
-	Epistemology concerns how we know things and the methods/validity of knowledge. If you are saying that revealed preference theory fails because it uses observed choices as a way of knowing preferences, and that this method is misleading since choices don’t fully reveal preferences under constraints, then the critique is epistemological. The problem is with the way knowledge is constructed and justified, not with the underlying reality itself.
-	If we start from different epistemologies, we will get different results – Harvey 1969 and Gregory 1978

# Axiomatic Utility Theory
The deductive approach requires an *a prior* utility specification, from which predictions about behaviour are made. Axiomatic models have been developed for a wide variety of situations based on the following general form

$$U(X,Z)$$
where $X$ is a vector of alternative attributes and $Z$ is a vector of individual attributes (with alternative-specific parameters for identification).

# Revealed Preferences
Samuelson 1938
(a) the assumption of linearity of marginal
utility; (b) the assumption of independence of utilities;
(c) the assumption of the measurability of utility in a cardinal
sense; and (d) even the assumption of an integrable field
of preference elements.. utility as a. psychological concept
robbed it of its only possible virtue as an explanation -of
human behaviour in other than a circular sense. meaning of the marginal rate of substitution as
entity independent of any psychological, introspective
implications would be, to say the least, ambiguous, and
would seem an artificial convention in the explanation
price behaviour. All that follows shall relate to an idealised individual-
not necessarily, however, the rational homo-economicus

Assume the following single-valued indirect utility function (omitting one equation for identification of $n$ dependent variables)
$$\psi_i = h^i(p_1,\hdots,p_n,I) \forall i \in [2,\hdots,n]$$
subject to the constraint
$$\sum_{i=1}^n \psi_i p_i - I = 0$$

If this cost is less than or equal to the actual expenditure
in the first period when the first batch of goods was actually
bought, then it means that the individual could have
purchased the second batch of goods with the price and
income of the first situation, but did not choose to do so. Symbolically expressed as
$$[\psi'p] \leq [\psi p]$$

in case of denail of this restriction would render invalid all of the
former analysis of consumer's behaviour and the theory
of index numbers as shown later - "Logic is sound but are the underlying assumptions correct?" Total cost is equal but prefer psi to psi' at the same price

$$[\psi'p'] < [\psi p']$$
You will still prefer psi if the price levels change on both bundles

Woe to any who deny any one of the three
postulates here! For they are, of course, deducible as
theorems from the conventional analysis.

they are all " revealed"
to be inferior to A. - "Assumes a) all options are available and b) inferiority is measured at a particular income level (discrete choice and/or minimum levels mean some options superior but baseline price is outside feasible set - expensive car, etc.)" "SP about removing the structural technical and income barriers and examining the inherent properties of the good - then can backtrack to technology and income/price to examine how a change could be manifest through efficiency and/or policy."

we know that this first crude approximation Z': (x, y)
= (I5, I5) clearly revealed itself to be "worse" than (x, y) = (IO,30)
-since the former was actually chosen over the latter even though
both cost the same amount. This suggests that the Cauchy-Lipschitz
process will always approach the true solution curve, or " indifference
curve ", from below

We may follow Mr. Little's terminology and give the name " behaviour
line " to the unique curve which lies between the points definitely
shown to be better than A, and those definitely shown to be worse
than A. This happens to coincide with the mathematical solution to
the differential equation, and we may care to give this contour line,
by courtesy, the title of an indifference curve.1

points revealed to be superior. The points lying literally on a
(concave) frontier locus can never themselves be revealed to be better
or worse than A. If we wish, then, we may speak of them as being
indifferent to A.


2 The above remarks apply without qualification to two dimensional problems where the
problem of " integrability " cannot appear. In the multidimensional case there still remain
some problems, awaiting a solution for more than a decade now.

Many social scientists other than
psychologists try to account for the
behavior of individuals.
Economists
and a few psychologists have pro
duced
a large body of theory and a
few experiments that deal with indi
vidual
decision making. The kind of
decision making with which this body
of theory deals is as follows: given
two states, A and B, into either one of
which an individual may put himself,
the individual chooses A in prefer
ence
to B (or vice versa).
For in

a child standing in front of a
candy counter may be considering
two states. In state A the child has
$0.25 and no candy.
In state B the
child has $0.15 and a ten-cent candy
bar. The economic theory of decision
making is a theory about how to pre
dict
such decisions.... economic theorists have studied this problem since the
days

Other social scientists have not shared economists' inhibitions about collec-

The derived bounds are nonparametrically estimable and may be used to test the best-case hypothesis. Contrary to
assertions in the literature, there is no reason to think that individual-level differences between intentions and behavior should
"average out" in the aggregate.



Ecomometrica, Manski (2004), Measuring expectations, The form of revealed preference analysis introduced by Samuelson (1938, 1948) supposes that a researcher observes the consumption bundles that a single person chooses when facing different budget sets with varying relative prices. Samuelson showed that observation of multiple (consumption, price, income) realizations, when combined with basic assumptions of consumer the- ory, implies restrictions on the consumption bundles that this person would choose when facing other budget sets. This idea, while beautifully simple, is more a thought experiment than a practical proposal; empirical researchers rarely observe the person-specific data that Samuelson envisioned.2 Research in axiomatic decision theory similarly rests on a thought experiment in which one can observe the decisions that one person would make when facing many alternative choice sets (e.g., Savage (1954

This idea, while beautifully simple, is

assumed that their preferences are homogeneous in some respects. Blundell (2003) reviews the
literature and explores the extent to which heterogeneity in preferences can be accommodated. The more practical form of revealed preference analysis developed by
McFadden (1974) supposes that a researcher observes the decisions random sample of heterogeneous persons, each of whom faces one discrete

# Why We need Both RP and SP
"theory is to wish a plague on both their houses and to argue that we simply get on with empirical work, in the belief that the facts will dictate which approach is more appropriate. No matter how appealing and pragmatic this might sound, however, it is not possible to separate theory and reality in this way. Indeed, the debate about the relationship between empirical observations and theoretical claims is yet another example of the same kind of dialectical dispute. Theory and observation cannot be separated from one another, and the ontological priority of the one or the other is an interminable dispute in philosophy that parallels in many ways those in economic geography outlined above." - Sheppard 1990, The Capitalist Space Economy
