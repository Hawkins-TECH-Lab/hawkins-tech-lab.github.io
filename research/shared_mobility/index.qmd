We define shared mobility as any form of transportation with a shared ownership or use structure. The fair and efficient deployment of shared mobility can address objectives related to mobility, efficient inter-modal transportation, and minimized resource requirements. We focus on understanding the relationship between shared modes through the use of data science and data, both Big and small.
