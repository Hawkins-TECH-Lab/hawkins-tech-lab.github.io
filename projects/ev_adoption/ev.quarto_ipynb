        "Transportation is the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions source in the United States (28%). As such, reducing emissions from this sector is an important step towards addressing climate change impacts. One strategy to address this impact is the electrification of personal vehicles. In this study, we focus on electric vehicle (EV) adoption factors. Past studies on this topic have framed the vehicle adoption question around small vehicles. However, most Americans (60-70%) drive larger vehicles (i.e., SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks). Our goal in this study was to understand how attitudes about EV adoption vary across the population.\n",

        "The survey was administered in Qualtrics and distributed to 2,000  respondents in March, 2023 via an online panel company. Responses were screened for completion time and various other quality checks. After further post-completion quality controls, 1,954 complete responses were used in analysis. Respondent locations are shown below in an interactive map. Each respondent completed six stated preference experiments about their vehicle choice preferences. The available responses were \"small car - gas\", \"small car - electric\", \"large car - gas\", \"large car - electric\", \"pickup truck - gas\", and \"pickup truck - electric\" where *gas* is an internal combustion engine vehicle and *electric* is a plugin electric vehicle. Additional details on the stated preference experiment are provided below.\n"

        "One of the dimensions that was identified by the research team as missing in prior studies is driving frequency off public roads. It is widely known in the transportation planning community that active mode (walking and cycling) trips are underreported in traditional data sources (e.g., the National Household Travel Survey in the U.S.). When asked about daily trips, survey respondents frequently do not report recreational active mode trips, such as walking the dog around the block. We had the hypothesis that a similar under-reporting may occur among rural residents who use their personal vehicles on their property. This travel may be important for these residents when considering an EV, as it will deplete the vehicle battery (and therefore driving range). For example, a rancher may drive their pickup truck on their property to check on cows and then drive into town. Prior surveys likely missed this travel, resulting in an under-reporting of rural travel. The question was worded as follows: How often do you use your vehicle off public roads for work purposes (e.g., on your property or private roads)? after an initial screening question for whether the respondent makes such trips.\n",
        "\n",
        "As expected, we found that those working in the farming, fishing, and foresty sectors are the most likely to travel off public roads for work. Further, they are the most likely to make such trips at least once per week. We also found a high rates for government and construction workers. Government workers may be driving in parks or to perform inspections on farms or industrial sites. Management and professional works also report making off-road trips. These trips may include engineers and other professional employees visiting farm, forestry, and industrial work sites. However, our main finding is significant travel that we do not believe is reported on conventional travel surveys (e.g., the NHTS).\n"

        "We also asked about the timing for the next vehicle purchase. The below figure summarizes these results by vehicle powertrain choice. We find that many people in the Midwest anticipate their next vehicle will have an internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain - i.e., be either gasoline or diesel. However, those who plan to purchase their next vehicle in greater than 4 years are more likely to buy a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Battery electric vehicle (BEV) purchase intention may grow to 20% but generally hovers around the current national average sales rate of 10%. This result indicates that current intention does not align with climate mitigation scenarios requiring widescale BEV adoption across the country."

However, 17% of the population lacks a dedicated parking space and a further 12% rely on shared parking that could not accomodate EV charging equipment."

        "# Conclusions\n",
        "Our initial results suggest that rural travel may be under-reported in conventional statistics due to travel on personal property and private roads for work purposes. This under-reporting will affect the viability of EV adoption in these areas because residents will face driving range factors not properly incorporated into existing analyses. We designed a novel stated preference experiment focused on electric pickup truck adoption. Our initial analysis indicates that electrification in this vehicle market will be slower than among small car owners.\n",
