Reliability, safety, comfort, convenience, etc.\n\n## Explanatory Variables in Mode Choice Models {.smaller}\nTripmaker Specific Variables\n\n- Income\n- Vehicle availability\n- No. of vehicles in household\n- Driver’s license? (0/1)\n- Age\n- Gender\n- Occupation\n- Household composition\n\n## Modeled Alternatives: The Choice Set\nThe number & definition of modeled modes depends on\n\n  - Problem application\n  - Available data\n  - Network modeling capabilities\n- **At a minimum**, requires some representation of competition between auto & transit\n\n## Auto Mode Representation {.smaller}\n- Common to distinguish between drivers & passengers:\n  - **Auto driver mode:** trip-maker drives a vehicle from origin to destination\n  - **Auto passenger mode:** trip-maker is a passenger in  car from origin to destination\n- Alternatively, we can distinguish between drive alone & shared trips\n  - **Drive alone mode:** trip-maker is sole occupant of vehicle from origin to destination (single occupancy vehicle (SOV) trip)\n  - **Shared-ride mode:** trip-maker is one of several vehicle occupants from origin to destination\n    - **Car driver** for shared ride\n    - **Car passenger** for shared ride with household member\n    - **Car pooling:** driver or passenger in vehicle with non-household members\n\n## Transit Mode Representation\n- Possible ways to categorize transit include\n    - **Local** (e.g., StarTran or Metro Transit) vs. **regional** (e.g., OMALiNK or N-E Ride)\n    - **Surface shared right-of-way** (bus, streetcar) vs. **dedicated ROW** (subway, LRT, busway)\n    - **Bus** vs. **rail**\n    - **Regular service** vs. **express** vs. **other premium service**\n\n## Mixed Modes\n- Combined auto-transit modes exist, in which auto is used to access transit system\n  - **Park & Ride:** trip-maker drives to a transit station & parks their vehicle at station\n  - **Kiss & Ride:** trip-maker is driven as a passenger to a transit station & is dropped off there\n- Auto access greatly expands  **catchment area** of transit services\n\n## Other Modes {.smaller}\nThere has been an explosion of modes in the last decade\n\n- Transportation network companies (TNCs): Uber, Lyft\n  - Single ride\n  - Pooled rides & van pools\n- Regular taxis\n- Motorcycles\n- Jitneys\n- Ferries, water taxis\n- Non-motorized modes\n  - Walking\n  - Bicycling\n  - E-bikes\n  - E-Scooters\n\n## Decision Structure\n- Mode choice can be represented as **decision tree**\n- Each node of tree represents an alternative & relationships among choices indicated via hierarchical tree structure (often called **nesting structure**)\n\n![](../images/lecture6/decision-structure.png){.absolute bottom=\"0\" right=\"250\" width=75%}\n\n## Alternative Decision Structures\n![](../images/lecture6/alt-decision-structure.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model\nA regional morning peak-period work trip mode choice model is a three-mode logit model as follows\n\nd = auto-drive\n\np = auto passenger\n\nt = transit\n\n## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model \n$V_m$ = utility for mode m\n\n$COST_m$ = out-of-pocket travel cost ($) for mode m\n\n$IVTT_m$ = in-vehicle travel time (min.) for mode m\n\n$OVTT_m$ = out-of-vehicle travel time (min.) for mode m\n\nNVEH = avg. no. of vehicles per household in home zone\n\nTWY = 1 if employment zone is located within the catchment area of a transitway station outside the CBD\n           = 0 otherwise\n\nREGION = 1 if home zone is located in a specific area\n                = 0  otherwise\n\n\n## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model {.smaller}\nSystematic utility functions\n\n$$𝑉_𝑑=−0.55−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇_𝑑−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑑+0.75×𝑁𝑉𝐸𝐻$$\n\n$$𝑉_𝑝=−2.28−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇_𝑝−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑝−0.30×𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡\n+0.45×𝑁𝑉𝐸𝐻$$\n\n$$𝑉_𝑡=−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇_𝑡−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡−0.30×𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡+1.07×𝑇𝑊𝑌\n−0.98×𝑅𝐸𝐺𝐼𝑂𝑁$$\n\n## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model\n![](../images/lecture6/mode-ex.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Important Notes on Mode Choice Example {.smaller}\n- Cost, IVTT, & OVTT are **generic variables**\n  - Enter all utility with same parameter values (no OVTT for driver)\n- NVEH is an **alternative specific variable**\n  - Enters two utility functions with **different parameter values**\n- There are **alternative specific constants** for drive & passenger modes but not transit\n  - If there are M alternatives, we can statically identify M-1 alternative specific constants (ASC)\n  - ASC account for unobserved but non-random variation – ASC will match **market share** for multinomial logit model\n\n## Important Notes on Mode Choice Example {.smaller}\n- Socio-economic variables **do not vary** between alternatives\n  - If included in model, must enter as alternative specific variables\n  - If included in model as generic variables, would add same utility to all alternatives & have no impact on choice probability\n  - Can interact socio-economic variables with level of service (LOS) variables\n    - E.g., travel cost / household income\n\n## Calculating Value of Travel Time (VTT) from Utility Function {.smaller}\n- We can calculate an implied VTT from model coefficients\n- From our previous example\n\n$$−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇($)=−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇(𝑚𝑖𝑛)$$\n\n- How many $ would one pay to reduce their travel time by one hour?\n\n$$𝑉𝑇𝑇=𝛽_{𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒}/𝛽_{𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡} =(−0.20)/(−0.57)=$21/ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟$$\n\n- Similarly, VTT for OVTT = $31.6/hour\n- **Question:** How do you think VTT for IVTT compares for **auto** vs. **transit** modes?\n\n## Direct & Cross Elasticity\n- **Direct elasticity:** direct effect of changing a variable value related to a good on demand for the **same good**\n  - E.g., elasticity of transit demand wrt transit fare, transit travel time, or transit headway\n- **Cross elasticity:** effect of changing a variable value related to a good on demand for a **different good**\n - E.g., elasticity of transit demand wrt auto travel time\n\n## Logit -  Direct Elasticity\n- Direct elasticity of the probability of an individual $n$ choosing alternative $i$ wrt a change in an attribute/independent variable $X_{ik}$ with coefficient $\\beta_k$ (ignoring $n$ subscripts for simplicity)\n\n$$e_{direct} = \\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial X_{ik}}\\frac{X_{ik}}{P_i} = (1-P_i)X_{ik}\\beta_k$$\n\n## Logit -  Cross Elasticity {.smaller}\n- Cross elasticity of the probability of an individual $n$ choosing alternative $i$ wrt a change in an attribute/independent variable $X_{jk}$ with coefficient $\\beta_k$ for a **different alternative**\n\n$$e_{cross}=-P_j X_{jk} \\beta_k$$\n\n- Above is same regardless of alternative $i$. I.e., **all** modes have the same cross-elasticity wrt an attribute $k$ of mode alternative $j$\n  - Above results from independence of irrelevant alternatives (**IIA**) property of basis logit model\n\n## Forecasting Mode Choice (Model Application) {.smaller}\n- Mode choice models generate choice probability predictions for individuals\n- For planning purposes, we are interested in total number of people in a zone or study area likely to choose each mode\n- Must aggregate individual choices\n  - Total enumeration/microsimulation\n  - Sample enumeration\n  - Naïve aggregation\n  - Classify with naïve aggregation\n\n## Total Enumeration\n- Simplest method but often not practical\n- Enumerate all individuals in study area\n- Calculate mode choice probabilities\n- Sum probabilities over all individuals\n- **Problem:** extremely expensive to survey all individuals & difficult to simulate them\n- Microsimulation models can be used to simulate individuals\n\n## Sample Enumeration\n- Second best to total enumeration\n- Requires representative sample of population\n- Calculate mode choice probabilities for sample\n- Sample prediction of mode shares can be substituted for population prediction\n- **Problem:** How to synthesize a sample for a future year?\n\n## Naive Aggregation\n- Treat individual choice model as an aggregate model\n- Use zonal averages for variables as inputs to compute “average” zonal probability\n- Problem: Choice probabilities are non-linear functions of variables so aggregation bias\n- Avoid this method!\n\n## Classification with Naive Aggregation\n- Classify population into relatively homogenous groups\n- E.g., by vehicle ownership & transit availability\n- Determine variable averages for each classification group\n- Use group averages to compute average mode shares\n- Sum mode shares\n- Most common method used in practice\n\n## Classification with Naïve Aggregation Example {.smaller}\nA work trip mode split logit model includes the no. of hh. vehicles (NVEH) and whether a worker has a driver’s license (DLIC) as variables. The aggregation/forecasting procedure used is to:\n\n- Divide workers into “n” NVEH & DLIC categories\n- Estimate percentage of workers in each category by O-D pair\n- Compute mode choice probabilities for each category\n- Compute weighted average mode splits for each O-D pair\n\n## Aggregation Bias\n- Consider a zone in which people are identical except for their income, and that the probability of a person using transit depends only on the person’s income.\n\n![](../images/lecture6/agg-bias-1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Aggregation Bias\n- Bias becomes worse for more heterogenous populations\n\n![](../images/lecture6/agg-bias-2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Forecasting Example {.smaller}\n$$𝑉_𝑎=\\beta_1+\\beta_2 𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_a+\\beta_4 𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑎+\\beta_5 ((𝑂𝑃𝑇𝐶_a)/𝐼𝑁𝐶)+\\beta_6 𝐴𝑂$$\n\n$$𝑉_𝑡=\\beta_3 𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡+\\beta_4 𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡+\\beta_5 ((𝑂𝑃𝑇𝐶_𝑡)/𝐼𝑁𝐶)$$\n\n- IVTT = in-vehicle travel time\n- OVTT  = out-of-vehicle travel time\n- OPTC = out-of-pocket travel cost\n- INC = household income\n- AO = auto ownership level\n\n![](../images/lecture6/util-func.png){.absolute bottom=\"0\" right=\"250\" width=75%}\n\n## Forecasting Example - Full Enumeration & Naive Aggregation {.smaller}\nIn this example, naive aggregation results in 3% **overprediction** of auto\n\n![](../images/lecture6/tota-enum.png){.absolute bottom=\"50\" left=\"0\" width=50%}\n\n![](../images/lecture6/naive-agg.png){.absolute bottom=\"0\" right=\"0\" width=50%}\n\n## Forecasting Example - Full Enumeration & Classification with Naive Aggregation {.smaller}\nIn this example, classification with naive aggregation results in <1% **overprediction** of auto\n\n![](../images/lecture6/tota-enum.png){.absolute bottom=\"50\" left=\"0\" width=50%}\n\n![](../images/lecture6/class-enum.png){.absolute bottom=\"0\" right=\"0\" width=50%}\n\n## Destination Choice\n- Like mode choice, we can consider the **trip distribution** process using disaggregate choice models\n- **Destination choice models** attempt to represent the decision-process by individuals when deciding where to make a trip\n\n![](../images/lecture6/destination-choice.png){.absolute bottom=\"0\" right=\"0\" width=75%}\n\n## Destination Choice\n- Unfortunately, destination choice is more complex than mode choice due to **choice set explosion**\n- We can address challenge by making use of logit properties to draw a **random sample of alternatives**\n\n![](../images/lecture6/destination-choice-2.png){.absolute bottom=\"0\" right=\"0\" width=75%}\n\n## Joint Mode-Destination Choice\nOften mode-destination choice a **joint process**: choosing to walk will affect destination choice & choosing a close destination will affect mode choice\n\n![](../images/lecture6/mode-dest-choice.png){.absolute bottom=\"50\" right=\"50\" width=80%}\n\n## Other Choices {.smaller}\n- Home location choice (**multinomial logit**) – similar to destination choice\n- Vehicle ownership choice? 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. vehicles (**ordered logit**)\n- Departure time choice? 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, etc. (**ordered logit**)\n- Party size choice? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. persons (**ordered logit**)\n- Choice set formation\n  - What destinations do I consider?
