$$Daily HH School Trips=1+0.2 HH Workers$$\n-   **No**: There’s no logical/causal relationship between no. of workers & school trips\n:::\n\n## Or Could The School Model Make Sense?... {.smaller}\n\n#### International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria:\n\n-   Women with no schooling - **4.5 children**\n-   Women with 2-3 years of primary school – **3 children**\n-   Women who complete one or two years of secondary school - **1.9 children** (replacement rate is 2.1 children)\n-   With one or two years of college, the average childbearing rate falls even further, to **1.7**\n-   When women enter the workforce, start businesses, inherit assets, & otherwise interact with men on an equal footing, children per household fades even more dramatically\n\n## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}\n\n#### Some important considerations\n\n-   Zonal models can explain **variation between zones**\n    -   For this reason, only successful if inter-zonal variations reflect real reasons for trip variation\n    -   Necessary that zones are homogeneous in socioeconomic composition & represent a wide range of conditions\n    -   **Major problem** is that main variation in person trips is intra-zonal\n-   **Role of intercept**: One would expect estimated regression line to pass through zero but large intercepts are common. **Why?**\n-   **Null zones**: No information about certain dependent variables (e.g., no. HB trips in a non-residential zone). These zones must be excluded from analysis\n\n## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}\n\n#### Some important considerations cont…\n\n-   **Zonal totals vs. zonal means**: when formulating model, analyst has choice between **aggregate** or **total variables**, such as trips per zone or cars per zone vs. rates, such as trips per household or cars per household in the zone\n-   Important difference: $$Y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 X_{1i}+\\beta_2 X_{2i}+…+\\beta_k X_{𝑘𝑖}+E_𝑖 \\text{ (total trip model)}$$ $$𝑦_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1i+\\beta_2 x_2i+…+\\beta_k x_{𝑘𝑖}+e_i \\text{ (trip rate model)}$$\n-   Where $y_i=Y_i/H_i$, $x_i=X_i/H_i$, & $e_𝑖=E_i/H_i$\n\n## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}\n\n#### Even more important considerations...\n\n-   Similar equations & parameters have a similar interpretation\n-   **However**, unless $H_i$ is constant across zones, constant variance condition cannot hold for error terms in total trips model\n-   Aggregate variables reflect size of zone, thus magnitude of error depends on size of zone - heteroskedasticity (variability in variance)\n-   Using a $1/H_i$ multiplier normalizes the model & reduces heteroskedasticity because model becomes independent of zone size\n-   Aggregate variable models often yield higher $R^2$ but spurious effect from zone size helping to explain total trips\n-   **DO NOT** mix rate & aggregate variables in same model\n\n## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}\n\n-   Even when rates used, zonal regression is conditioned by nature & size of zones (**spatial aggregation problem**)\n-   Interzonal variance diminishes with larger zone size\n\n![](../images/lecture3/zone_regression_table.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Household-Based Regression {.smaller}\n\n-   Intra-zonal variation may be reduced by decreasing zone size but there are **two problems**\n    -   **More expensive models** in terms of data collection, calibration, & operation\n    -   **Larger sampling errors** (regression to mean with larger samples, so small zone means not capturing average person), which is assumed non-existent by multiple linear regression model\n-   **Household** used rather than **person** because we have a hard time incorporating **intra-household dynamics** (e.g., vehicle availability) - Some advances but still not great\n-   Can decide on variables in **step-wise process** but must be careful - May exclude a variable with slightly lower prediction that is easier to forecast\n-   Opposite approach of including all variables & removing variables can be a better approach\n\n## Validity of Linear Regression Assumption {.smaller}\n\n-   Regression models are easy to construct & use\n-   **However**, underlying assumptions may be wrong\n    -   Linearity\n    -   No correlations between explanatory variables\n-   Residuals are estimates of error in model obtained from subtracting predicted from observed dependent variable values\n    -   Residual $e_i = y_{i,observed} – y_{i,predicted}$\n    -   Residuals should be normally distributed with constant variance – can plot a histogram to check\n    -   Residuals should be uncorrelated with any explanatory variable – can plot residuals vs. explanatory variables\n\n## Histogram of Residuals\n\n![](../images/lecture3/histogram_residuals.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Residuals Vs.

Successive steps were performed of a stepwise model estimation. Values (in parenthesis) are t-ratios. In the step 4 model, $Z_1$ takes the value 1 for households with one car and 0 otherwise and $Z_2$ takes the value 1 for households with two or more cars and 0 otherwise. We can see that zero car households will have the value 0 for both $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. Even without the higher $R^2$, the step 4 model would be preferred because it clearly demonstrates there is a **non-linear effect** that’s ignored by $𝑋_2$.\n:::\n\n![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_3.png){fig-align=\"right\"}\n\n## Variable Selection & Model Building {.smaller}\n\n-   **Problem**: Choose the set of appropriate explanatory variables from a set of candidate variables - **variable selection**\n-   Possible approaches\n    -   Exploring all possible variables - many combinations\n    -   Stepwise regression -\\> construct a sequence of regression models by adding or removing variables at each step\n        -   **Forward selection**: add variables to the model one at a time until there are no remaining candidate variables that improve fit\n        -   **Backward elimination**: begin with all possible variables & remove the least significant variables\n-   **Are there problems with these approaches?**\n\n## Variable Specification & Forecasting {.smaller}\n\n-   Consider variables **important for explaining differences** in trip-making decisions\n-   **Frequency** & **data plotting** gives idea of variability with respect to different variables\n-   Specify variables as per relationship\n    -   Continuous\n    -   Ordered\n    -   Discrete\n-   Variable choice depends on availability of observed information & capacity to forecast\n-   Statistical significance tests\n-   Model goodness of fit can be used to identify impact of specific variables\n\n## Model Validation {.smaller}\n\n-   A good way to validate a model is to compare **observed vs. modeled values** for some groupings of the data\n-   Better than comparing totals because **biases may cancel** in that case (high prediction cancels with low prediction)\n-   Errors are reasonably low (i.e., less than 30%)\n-   Large bias could be addressed by adjusting model parameters, but it’s not easy because there are no clear rules\n\n![](../images/lecture3/validation_table.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"40%\"}\n\n## Model Validation - Learning From Machine Learning\n\n-   Transportation planning field starting to adopt methods from **machine learning** field, including for validation\n    -   **Leave-one-out** (LOO) & **k-folds cross-validation** to get mean & std. dev.\n    -   **Score** (R2 for linear regression)\n    -   **Mean absolute error** (MAE)\n\n## Obtaining Zonal Totals {.smaller}\n\n-   Simple process for zone-based models because already modeling total trips\n-   Requires extra step for household-based models – multiplying by number of households\n    -   $T_i=H_i(0.91+1.44\\bar{X}_{1i}+1.07\\bar{X}_{2i}$ where $T_i$ is the total number of HB trips in zone $i$\n    -   With dummy variables, we need to know the number of households in each group\n    -   $T_i=H_i(0.84+1.41X)+0.75H_{1i}+3.14H_{2i}$ where $H_{1i}$ is the number of one vehicle households & $H_{2i}$ is the number of two vehicle households in zone $i$\n\n## Matching Generations & Attractions {.smaller}\n\n-   Models do not guarantee, by default, that total trips originating in a zone (the origins O_𝑖) at all zones will equal the total trips attracted (the destinations 𝐷_𝑗)\n\n-   Following expression may not hold $$\\sum_i O_i=\\sum_j D_j$$\n\n-   Generally assumed that trip generation models are **better** than trip attraction models\n\n-   Total trips are then $T=\\sum_i O_i$ & a factor applied to trip attraction $$f=T/\\sum_j D_j$$\n\n-   This equality is necessary for the next model step: **trip distribution**\n\n## Growth Factor Modeling {.smaller}\n\n-   Growth factor method given by $$T_{i+t}=F_tT_i$$\n-   Where $T_i$ is total trips at time $i$, $T_{i+t}$ is total trips at time $i+t$, & $F_i$ is a growth factor. Determining total current trips is a simple process but forecasting future trips (i.e., $F_t$) is a **big challenge**\n-   $F_t$ is related to variables such as population ($P$), income ($I$), & car ownership ($C$) $$F_t = \\frac{f(P_t,I_t,c_t)}{f(P_i,I_i,c_i)}$$\n\n## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}\n\nConsider a zone with 250 households with vehicles and 250 households without vehicles. Assuming we know the average trip generation rates of each group:\n\n-   Vehicle-owning households produce 6.0 trips/day\n-   Non-vehicle-owning households produce 2.5 trips/day\n\nWe can determine the current number of trips as $$T_i = 250 \\times 2.5 + 250 \\times 6.0 = 2125 \\text{ trips/day}$$\n\n## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}\n\n-   Let’s assume that all households in the future have a vehicle. We can then estimate a simple multiplicative growth factor as $$F_t = 1/0.5 = 2.0$$ $$T_{i+t} = 2 \\times 2125 = 4250 \\text{ trips/day}$$\n\n-   Growth factor methods are crude & generally used in practice for **external trips** where additional information is not available\n\n## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}\n\n-   Let us also assume that in the future all households will have a vehicle, but income & population remain unchanged\n\n$$T_i = 6 \\times 500 = 3000 \\text{ trips/day}$$\n\n-   **But do we expect non-vehicle households to make this many more trips if income is not changing?**\n\n## Stability & Updating Trip Generation Model {.smaller}\n\n-   **Temporal stability**: Population/socio-economic structure changes over time & affects trip rates\n-   **Geographic stability**: Trip-making patterns vary from place to place\n-   Updating trip generation models\n    -   If models were developed using **old data**, it is necessary to update the model for present situation\n    -   Best way to re-estimate trip generation model using **present data**\n    -   If sufficient data is **not available**, we can update previously estimated model using **small present data sample**\n\n## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}\n\n-   Standard variables are household totals, household size (and structure), number of vehicles owned, & household income\n-   **However**, there are many other factors that can be explored regarding household structure\n    -   Social circumstances likely affect travel\n    -   Personal living alone will have a different set of tradeoffs & coordination patterns than person living in with others\n    -   Multi-person household dynamics will vary depending on structure – several students living together may not coordinate trips in same way as a family\n    -   Elderly people living with younger people may be more engaged outside the home than those living alone or with similarly aged persons\n\n## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}\n\n-   **How do life course events affect trips?**\n    -   Appearance of a pre-school children\n    -   Time when youngest child reaches school age\n    -   Time when youth leaves home & lives alone, with other young adults, or marries\n    -   Time when all children of a couple have left home but couple has not retired yet\n    -   Time when all members of a household reach retirement age\n-   Important factors for identifying/classifying households as being in similar life stage & potentially having more **homogeneous travel patterns**\n-   **What about overall aging of population?** Age tends to be associated with decline in mobility in change in lifestyle\n\n## Trip Generation Inelastic In Most Models\n\n-   Independent of the level of service provided in the transport system\n-   Probably **unrealistic** but **only recently** techniques have been developed which can take systematic account of these (induced demand) effects\n\n## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}\n\n-   **Trip or journey**: one-way movement from an origin point to a destination point\n    -   **Home-based (HB) trip**: trip with the home (or hotel for a nonresident) being either the trip origin or destination\n    -   **Non-home-based (NHB) trip**: trip where neither end of the trip is the home\n    -   **Trip production**: defined as the home end of an HB trip or as the origin of an NHB\n    -   **Trip attraction**: defined as the non-home end of an HB trip or the destination of an NHB\n    -   **Trip generation**: total number of trips generated by households in a zone, both HB & NHB\n\n## What is the fundamental event of interest?

Determining total current trips is a simple process but forecasting future trips (i.e., $F_t$) is a **big challenge**\n-   $F_t$ is related to variables such as population ($P$), income ($I$), & car ownership ($C$) $$F_t = \\frac{f(P_t,I_t,c_t)}{f(P_i,I_i,c_i)}$$\n\n## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}\n\nConsider a zone with 250 households with vehicles and 250 households without vehicles. Assuming we know the average trip generation rates of each group:\n\n-   Vehicle-owning households produce 6.0 trips/day\n-   Non-vehicle-owning households produce 2.5 trips/day\n\nWe can determine the current number of trips as $$T_i = 250 \\times 2.5 + 250 \\times 6.0 = 2125 \\text{ trips/day}$$\n\n## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}\n\n-   Let’s assume that all households in the future have a vehicle. We can then estimate a simple multiplicative growth factor as $$F_t = 1/0.5 = 2.0$$ $$T_{i+t} = 2 \\times 2125 = 4250 \\text{ trips/day}$$\n\n-   Growth factor methods are crude & generally used in

stability**: Trip-making patterns vary from place to place\n-   Updating trip generation models\n    -   If models were developed using **old data**, it is necessary to update the model for present situation\n    -   Best way to re-estimate trip generation model using **present data**\n    -   If sufficient data is **not available**, we can update previously estimated model using **small present data sample**\n\n## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}\n\n-   Standard variables are household totals, household size (and structure), number of vehicles owned, & household income\n-   **However**, there are many other factors that can be explored regarding household structure\n    -   Social circumstances likely affect travel\n    -   Personal living alone will have a different set of tradeoffs & coordination patterns than person living in with others\n    -   Multi-person household dynamics will vary depending on structure – several students living together may not coordinate trips in same way as a family\n    -   Elderly people living with younger people may be more engaged outside the home than those living alone or with similarly aged persons\n\n## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}\n\n-   **How do life course events affect trips?**\n    -   Appearance of a pre-school children\n    -   Time when youngest child reaches school age\n    -   Time when youth leaves home & lives alone, with other young adults, or marries\n    -   Time when all children of a couple have left home but couple has not retired yet\n    -   Time when all members of a household reach retirement age\n-   Important factors for identifying/classifying households as being in similar life stage & potentially having more **homogeneous travel patterns**\n-   **What about overall aging of population?** Age tends to be associated with decline in mobility in change in lifestyle\n\n## Trip Generation Inelastic In Most Models\n\n-   Independent of the level of service provided in the transport system\n-   Probably **unrealistic** but **only recently** techniques have been developed which can take systematic account of these (induced demand) effects\n\n## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}\n\n-   **Trip or journey**: one-way movement from an origin point to a destination point\n    -   **Home-based (HB) trip**: trip with the home (or hotel for a nonresident) being either the trip origin or destination\n    -   **Non-home-based (NHB) trip**: trip where neither end of the trip is the home\n    -   **Trip production**: defined as the home end of an HB trip or as the origin of an NHB\n    -   **Trip attraction**: defined as the non-home end of an HB trip or the destination of an NHB\n    -   **Trip generation**: total number of trips generated by households in a zone, both HB & NHB\n\n## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}\n\n-   **Activity**: short stay at a particular location\n    -   Usually has a purpose associated to it: work, study, shopping, leisure, etc.\n-   **Tour or trip chain**: a sequence of linked trips\n-   **Tours** & **activities** correspond more closely with the idea of travel as a derived demand than do the first concepts\n    -   Contemporary models are generally interested in **tours** rather than **trips**. **Why?**\n\n## Trip Generation & Accessibility {.smaller}\n\n-   Classical transport planning (4-step) model can incorporate an **iterative process** between distribution & assignment, leaving trip generation unaltered\n-   True even in most contemporary models, which attempt to appropriately solve supply-demand equilibrium problem\n-   **Disadvantage**: changes to network assumed to have no effect on trip productions & attractions\n    -   E.g., Extension of a subway line would not generate more trips between that zone & other zones\n    -   May hold for compulsory trips but unlikely to hold for discretionary trips\n\n## Trip Generation & Accessibility {.smaller}\n\n-   Attempts made to incorporate an **accessibility measure** into trip generation by replacing $O_i = f(H_i)$ by $f(H_i,A_i$ where $H_i$ are household characteristics & $A_i$ is an accessibility measure\n-   Accessibility generally defined by $A_i = \\sum_j f(E_j, C_{ij})$ where $E_j$ is an attraction measure for zone $j$ & $C_{ij}$ is a **generalized cost of travel** between zones $i$ & $j$.\n    -   Often give wrong sign or non-significant results due to unresolved model dynamics & problems from using cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data\n    -   Leads to **activity-based models** & trip frequency/scheduling choice models (discussed in **CIVE864**)"},"formats":{"revealjs":{"identifier":{"display-name":"RevealJS","target-format":"revealjs","base-format":"revealjs"},"execute":{"fig-width":10,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"mermaid-format":"png","df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","html-math-method":{"method":"mathjax","url":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full"},"slide-level":2,"to":"revealjs","output-file":"lec-3.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
