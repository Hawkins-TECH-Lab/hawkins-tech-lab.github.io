system behavior via mathematical equations based on theory\n-   Models provide common ground for discussing policy and outcomes with a level of objectivity\n-   Engineers/planners can learn much about

Transportation Planning (and CIVE461) Focus Shift {.smaller}\n\n-   Field is shifting towards methods that are more human-centered and realistic and away from the mechanistic methods adopted from physics analogy\n\n-   Focus on time, geographic space, social space, and institutional context\n\n-   We ignored complexity, non-linearity, and uncertainty in past approaches\n\n-   Traditional viewpoint of transport experts and policy makers is that transportation systems exist to provide for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in an environmentally responsible manner\n\n## Transportation Planning (and CIVE461) Focus Shift {.smaller}\n\n-   Decisions historically reserved for technical experts with very little (if any) public input\n-   In the 1970s, mainly because of the oil crisis, attention was also paid to managing the transportation system as a system of interconnected components\n-   Realizing increased capacity is not sufficient to satisfy increasing demand for services, policy analysts and policy makers shifted their attention to a more efficient management of facilities (e.g., utilize the capacity of a highway by spreading its use over the day)\n-   New construction reserved for strategic interventions such as the provision of connectivity among existing roadways\n-   Shift of policies away from expanding capacity to managing demand and the introduction of a systems approach to transportation has been advocated since the late 1960s – yet not adopted by many engineering undergraduate programs…\n\n## Transportation Planning (and CIVE461) Focus Shift {.smaller}\n\n-   More recent perspective: integrated and systematic view\n-   Economic and social development role\n-   Private automobile can be examined in a more critical way and contrasted with many other mobility options that may yield the same benefits but at lower social costs\n-   At the core is provision of access to activities and services for all (equity principle)\n-   Unfortunately, priority in transport policies has been given to higher mobility (ability to move) instead of higher accessibility (ability to reach locations and opportunities)\n-   Since mobility is “purchased,” specific groups of the urban or rural population do not have adequate access to basic services\n-   Yet, they are burdened with the costs (e.g., health, taxation) of mobility\n-   I have re-focused CIVE461 to provide you with the tools and knowledge to compete in the current transportation workforce\n\n## Workforce Trends {.smaller}\n\n-   Multi-modal transportation planning\n-   Complete Streets – Nebraska DOT focused on it for small communities\n-   Larger datasets = Excel -\\> R & Python\n-   Non-infrastructure solutions – ridesharing, autonomous vehicles, pricing, and land use reform\n\n![](../images/lecture1/inrix.png){.absolute top=\"0\" right=\"75\"} ![](../images/lecture1/lime.png){.absolute bottom=\"175\" left=\"200\"} ![](../images/lecture1/lyft.png){.absolute
