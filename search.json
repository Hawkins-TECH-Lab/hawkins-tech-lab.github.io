    "text": "Written after we crossed the country for my Ph.D. in 2017. I haven’t returned to Duluth, MN yet…\nWe just completed an exhausting 1 week tour of the northern states: North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. One of the major take aways for both Heather and myself was the various infrastructure we traversed in the course of our travels. I would like to discuss a bit of this, with some accomonying amateur photography.\n\nThis was the best case of a roller joint on a steel frame structure I have ever seen. It bring back mixed feelings about days in Structure Engineering courses during my undergraduage degree. \nThis was a mediocre brewery, but a great spot in Grand Forks, ND. It is situated adjacent to a major rail corridor and take full advantange. There are clear views of the trains rolling into town and by the brewery thanks to large windows looking out onto the street and alley. It was an excellent example of linking the present use of an older structure with its surrounding environment and historical industrial roots. \nWe drove into Duluth, MN with very little knowledge of its layout and no plans as to what to visit. This is I35 passing through downtown. We pulled off the highway at a downtown exit and planned to walk somewhere for lunch. This rapidly became more of a challenge than expected as it turned out the downtown is largely commercial and wayfinding signage proved less than helpful. The interstate acts to separate the downtown from the lakeshore. It is unclear from this side of the interstate whether there are additional services on the lakeshore side of the roadway and it is clearly prohibitive to pedestrians. We were able to find a pedestrian overpass to the lakeshore, which led to a quaint lakeside retail area. We were able to find an excellent brewery (sense a pattern) called Canal Park Brewing Company. I noticed a similar patttern of the commercial centre being separated from the tourist-focused lakeshore upon arrival in Toronto. This is a model reminiscent of the days of Robert Moses in New York, with his focus on placing large-scale transportation facilities along prime waterfront real estate. \nWe were unable to ride the train, but it gives some incentive to return to the Duluth, MN area. It promises excellent views of the Lake Superior shore and ends at Two Harbors, MN. It feels like a disservice to my profession to miss out on an historical train ride."

    "text": "Happy Canada Day!\nAs a member of the Zephyr Foundation, I spend a fair bit of time thinking about transportation analysis and how to make it more open and transparent. At the same time, I am an academic who conducts computational research and thinks about how to do a better job of sharing data, code, and papers. On the paper front, I do an okay job. On the data and code… it’s a work in progress. A few years ago (Joe Castiglione tells me it was maybe 2015), there was a session at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) annual meeting on hurrican forecasting and how they collaborate on model development. The implication is that we as transportation modelers could follow a similar path to more collaborative and transparent model practices. My perspective on this question comes from experience in local government, consulting, and academia. I think there are two difference between hurricane and transportation demand forecasting that are relevant to this discussion (likely many more, but let’s focus on two avoid a classic Hawkins multi-dimensional ramble).\nThe first difference is the spatial scope. Transportation demand models tend to be developed at the metropolitan or state scale. The reason this matters is that it has led to a competitive market among consulting firms. While a hurricane forecast model is essentially a natural monopoly - i.e., there is a large region affected and competing commercial models would not be feasible as only one contract would be awarded by a federal agency. Granted, there are competing research models for hurricans, which we do not tend to see in transportation where competition occurs among firms but across metropolitan areas (minimal comparison of models within a single region). Consider the excellent history of the transportation forecasting field in the United States by Konstantinos Chatzis. While including many prominent academics, it is predominantly a history of consultancy and commercial contracts rather than academic grants to develop general model systems (with the except of TRANSIMS, POLARIS, and a few other example) - note: while I love the POLARIS developers, it is still a largely commercial package in that model applications rely on grant dollars for development within a specific region and the codebase is not wholely available open access.\nThe second difference is the politics of transportation. I am not an expert on hurricanes and disaster management, but I think we can be fairly confident politics has less influence on the location of hurricanes (at the risk of a digression - politics certainly has some indirect effect on the frequency and severity of hurricanes through insufficient action on anthropogenic climate change). Transportation investments are an extremely politic process, particuarly at the scale assessed by transportation demand models. These politics lead to distorted incentives, legal battles, and other messiness.\nRelated to hurricane forecasting, climate models seek to forecast climatic conditions in response to technology and policy decisions, as well as economic and health impacts depending upon the particular model focus. Steve Easterbrook at the University of Toronto provides an excellent overview of this field in Computing The Climate. I’ve yet to shell out for the full book, but the Chapter 1, 2, and 9 are available online. The book is highly readable, including a nice history and summary of interviews with modeling teams from around the world. As stated by Steve: &gt; The question they were called upon to answer wasn’t whether the planet would warm in response to rising carbon dioxide emissions – by the late 1970s, that was no longer in dispute in the scientific community. The question was: how certain can we be about the numbers?\nHey, this sounds a lot like the uncertainty movement in transportation demand modeling! We’re just 50 years late to the game. One impetus for these efforts to understand climate uncertainty was a report from the JASON group (a group of top physicist advisors to the US president on nuclear security matters. They were named for Jason and the Argonauts - I wasn’t part of the team, being born many years after its inception). National Academy of Science (NAS) panels were established and many discussions had as to how best to model climate systems and quantify uncertainty. While NAS has empaneled many committees on transportation issues, to my understand they have not had the same collectivizing effect on our field.\nOne reason I like Steve’s book is that he is not a climate scientist. He is a computer scientist interested in how large teams of scientists, largely untrained in production grade software development practices, develop complex computer programs and manage quality control. This topic is generalizable and very useful to understand! Something I found interesting from the start was the MetOffice approach in the UK. Their climate model is built on the same code base as the weather model. The weather model must be run daily to provide forecasts to the UK government and public. As such, its code is constantly reviewed, optimized, and validated against observations. This software setup means the climate model code also exhibits a high level of consistency. The parallel I could draw to transportation is that we produce daily road condition reports, short-term forecasts at intersections, Waze routing recommendations, etc. However, these models are decentralized and variable. They are not a national forecast produced by one centralized agency. Within a metropolitan area, I could see a structure similar to that of the MetOffice being feasible. We have loads of new data and model providers - StreetLight, INRIX, Replica, etc. - which could be ingested into a short-term forecasting and analysis software framework. That same forecasting framework could be extended to provide long-range forecasts at greater spatial aggregation and with additional modules for auto ownership and other long-term decisions. It’s not a perfectly fleshed out idea, but it is something.\nCharney Sensitivity - You’ll have to read Steve’s book to get the full history, but Jules Charney was an early climate modeler - as in was tasked by John von Neumann in 1948 to build a weather forecasting program. The concept of Charney Sensitivity is simple. Double the \\(CO_2\\) in the atmosphere and see what happens a few decades in the future. Do models agree? The first issue we would face in transportation modeling is that not all models follow an evolutionary, path dependent, simulation approach. Many models forecast population, land use, economics, and transportation with separate and loosely coupled model systems. Furthermore, many of these models simply provide forecasts for a subset of future years (say 10, 25, 40 years into the future). It could be difficult to compare these models. One “elephant in the room” referenced above is that most models are developed by consultants. Backcasting to check the accuracy of a model or comparing your model against the competitor models may not be good for business. However, we can take a different perspective, as was done by Charney and his team when tasked with the problem of uncertainty quantification by US President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. While each model may provide a single output that will vary as a function of slight differences in model formulation and setup, the combination of results provides an uncertainty band on the climate (transportation) future."

    "title": "Schumacher On Scale",
    "section": "",
    "text": "“In the current vocabulary of condemnation there are few words as final and conclusive as the word ‘uneconomic’” (SIB, p. 44). Thus states Schumacher in his work “Small is Beautiful” (1973). I believe this pattern still holds true, as does Schumacher’s question as to the “meaning” produced by the methods of economics. Economics does not, and cannot, produce any other meaning aside from adequate profit. While such an assessment would be deemed incorrect by nearly all practicing economists - i.e., other forms of value can be translated into monetary terms, thus obviating the need for ethics, religion, and other forms of value generation. Social, aesthetic, moral, or political reasons need not apply. Robert F. Kennedy demonstrated agreement with the sentiment of Schumacher when, in an address to the University of Kansas on March 18, 1968, he stated “too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things”. Of course, if pressed on the matter, Kennedy might have demurred towards such a philosophy being a nice idea but impractical in the context of a Presidential administration.\nI also agree with Schumacher that cost/benefit analysis, while designed to account for costs and benefits that might otherwise go overlooked, tends to reduce the higher to the level of the lower and give a price to that which is priceless. I was particularly struck in my reading of Small Is Beatiful by the notion of “meta-economics”. That is, a bounding of the applicability of economics. Economics deals with the production of man within his/her environment. Meta-economics must then have two parts defined by (1) the study of man and (2) the study of the environment. The lack of understanding of this nature of the field makes for an economic calculus that is ignorant of the reliance of man on the natural world. Schumacher further distinguishes between primary goods (i.e., non-renewable and renewable resources) and secondary goods (i.e., manufactured goods and services). While economics often talks about “production”, Schumacher notes that we are converters only and lack the ability to produce primary goods.\nSchumacher turns to the topic of scale through a discussion of a Buddhist-based economic system as a contrast to Western materialism. Schumacher was not a Buddhist. In fact, he was largely irreligious. Buddhism is simply used as one value system (among many) as a basis for an alternative meta-economics. Let us begin with the notion of work. Economics defines work as a disutlity, to me minimized or removed through the application of technology. The Buddhist perspective provides a threefold motivation for labour. First, it is a means to utilize and develop skills. Second, to ovecome the ego by joining with other people in a common task. Third, to produce the goods and services necessary for a fulfilled life. By this viewpoint, work and leisure are equally important and complementary aspects of life. We now come to the question of scale. To the modern economist, standard of living is measured by the amount of consumption. To a Buddhist economist, such a perspective is irrational! Schumacher gives the excellent example of clothing. If the purpose of clothing is to regulate temperature and provide modesty, then the objective will be to provide these outcomes with the minimal input of labour and materials. “It would be highly uneconomic, for instance, to go in for complicated tailoring like the modern West, when a much more beautiful effect can be achieved by the skilful draping of uncut material” (SIB, p. 61).\nSchumacher argues that scaling and agglomeration dominate, not only modern economic thought, but any number of other fields. He spends some time talking about the appropriate size of a city, setting an upper limit of 500,000 inhabitants. This topic may be one that Schumacher and I differ, at least on the surface. I am a great lover of cities. It is hard not to appreciate large infrastructure as a trained civil engineer. However, I believe Schumacher and I may be in agreement that large scale settlement is only successful when decomposable into smaller units. Having spent time in Toronto as a graduate student, a metropolitan region of far more than 500,000, I believe its success comes from its ability to be decomposed into smaller spatial and social units. This principle relates to the in-vogue concept of the 15-minute city. A mostly self-contained community in terms of access to services is ideal. It is when we scale economic provisioning, such as retail provided at centralized “Big Box Stores”, that the hazards of scale manifest as long and congested travel times. Likewise, recent writings on the benefits of local governance and the power of mayors align well with Schumacher’s downscaling of governance to the community scale. Schumacher advocates for a refocusing of policy on people over goods and profit - “production by the masses, rather than mass production” (SIB, p. 79). This is a movement that I can get behind sitting in my basement writing for an audience of one simply because I enjoy the work."

    "title": "Schumacher On Prediction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Best known for his work on small-scale economics, in the same work (Small is Beautiful), E.F. Schumacher provides one of the best discussions on prediction that I have seen to date. It is also an excellent example of semantics applied in its true sense, rather than the typical pejorative meaning associated with the term in many discussions.\nSchumacher distinguishes prediction along three dimensions using a set of \\(2^3 = 8\\) cases as follows:\n\n\n\nAct Past Certain\nAct Future Certain\nAct Past Uncertain\nAct Future Uncertain\n\n\n\nEvent Past Certain\nEvent Future Certain\nEvent Past Uncertain\nEvent Future Uncertain\n\n\n\nLet us first discuss acts and events. The first (acts) are active and “within the control of the planner”, while the second (events) are passive and “outside the control of the planner”. The planner may be able to forecast events and their influence on plans, but they cannot be part of the plans. Plan and estimate, while appearing to apply to the future only, are often applied to past events. For example, “I shall not visit Paris without a plan” can mean “I shall arm myself with a street plan for orientation” - case 5 because the plan construction is a certain event that occured in the past outside your control. Alternatively, “I shall arm myself with a plan which outlines in advance where I am going to go and how I am going to spend my time and money” - case 2 or 4 depending on the certainty of said plans. Similarly, estimate may refer to either the past or the future. Past events often remain uncertain due to measurement error and other factors.\nHaving spent the better part of the last decade studying human behaviour and forecasting it under alternative conditions, I found Schumacher’s classification system encapsulated much of what I believe about the ability to forecast behaviour. I follow Schumacher’s definitions with a short commentary.\n\nFull predictability (in principle) exists only in the absence of human freedom - i.e., in “sub-human” nature. The limitations of predictability are purely limitations of knowledge and technique.\n\nThat is, if we assume no human freedom and deterministic choice, 100% accurate prediction is feasible provided we have all the available information and the correct model structure. I have the sense that many of my field are of the opinion that Big Data and Artificial Intelligence bring us daily closer to this reality. I am not so readily convinced of this fact.\n\nRelative predictability exists with regard to the behaviour pattern of large numbers of people doing “normal” things (routines).\n\nIn transportation modeling, we would call this travel on a typical day and aggregate (4-step) demand modeling.\n\nRelatively full predictability exists with regard to human actions controlled by a plan which eliminates freedom, e.g., railway timetables.\n\nI like this example for obvious reasons.\n\nIndividual decisions by individuals are in principle unpredictable.\n\nI agree with this statement. I see the shift towards disaggregate modeling as a means to increase prediction accuracy and nuance for large numbers of people (point 2 above) rather than a suggestion that we can accurately predict the individual decisions at which the model is set up.\nSchumacher then touches on a point that has recently seen great interest in the transportation demand modeling community - uncertainty. He states “all long-term forecasting is somewhat presumptuous and absurd, unless it is of so general a kind that it merely states the obvious”. Schumacher emphasizes the need to focus on modeling as a tool for exploratory calculations rather than forecasting, per se. In forecasting, we are stating that a certain set of conditions will be the case in 20 years time or, in the slightly more nuanced form of the same, that differences from current conditions will have some absolute value. E.g., we forecast future traffic and make statements about the difference in traffic on particular roads given a change in infrastructure. An exploratory approach includes multiple potential futures and considers the “long-term effect of certain assumed tendencies”. Schumacher uses a development example. He proposes a backcasting exercise to explore potential pathways for the uplift of underdeveloped nations. “What would be the required output of foodstuffs, fuels, metals, textile fibres, and so forth? What would be the stock of industrial capital?” Many new assumptions would be necessarily along the way and the outcome would be a set of feasibility studies to indicate the most feasible among alternative patterns of development. The discussion here is again (partially) one of semantics. We must recognize that long-term forecasts are infeasible, while long-term feasibility study can be a worthwhile exercise."

    "title": "Jevons Paradox",
    "section": "",
    "text": "William Stanley Jevons was a 19th century English economist and logician. He made extensive contributions to the field, yet is perhaps best known for his eponymous paradox. Jevons Paradox arises when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing unit consumption), but the falling marginal cost of use induces increases in demand such that aggregate resource use is increased, rather than reduced. Engineers are, in general terms, believers in the benefits of technology. Efficiency gains are professed to solve any number of social and environmental ills. E.g., autonomous vehicles will solve traffic congestion and improved safety through their elimination of fallible human drivers. Consider the narrative regarding the population theory of another late 18th century/early 19th century economist - Thomas Malthus. Malthus predicted population collapse in response to population growth outstripping agricultural productivity growth. Thus far, his prediction has not come to pass partially due to technological progressing, including the 20th century Green Revolution (led by Norman Borlaug and others), which relieved starvation concerns - yay! Techno-optimists reference this success as an exemplar of why technology will save us. Furthermore, the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve (named for yet another economist, Simon Kuznets) anticipates GDP becoming decoupled from environmental impacts as a nation moves from an industrial to a post-industrial economy.\nLet us take a look at the Kuznets Curve in the context of Jevons Paradox. If we assume a steady state economy, then it may be the case that environmental impacts will decrease as a function of technological progress. By a steady state economy, we mean a constant stock of capital and fixed population.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we do not exist in a steady state economy, global population continues to grow (rising from 6 billiong to 8 billion people in my own lifetime). While natural resources are a fixed stock (we will return to this topic on many occassions), our rate of resource consumption has not declined as a function of technological progress. Rather, we continue to consume increasing quantities of materials and energy, which represent the fundamental building blocks of human society. Another way to term a steady state economy is that its size is a non-stationary function of time. Stationarity will be a familiar term to those with a background in statistics or econometrics - refering to the lack of equilibrium about a fixed level of resource consumption in this case. With GDP encouraged to grow without limit, Jevons Paradox quickly comes to bear. Technological progress will get us only so far when faced with the tasks of overcoming a non-stationarity system.\nWe can consider the problem from the perspective of aggregate environmental impact vs. marginal (unit) environmental impact. Jevons Paradox shows us that individuals will increase their environment impacts (vis-a-vis more consumption) in response to technological innovations that reduce the marginal cost, or material and energy requirements - i.e., increasing aggregate individual impacts. At the same time, additional individuals (i.e., population growth) compounds the impacts, even should these new individuals consume resources at a diminished rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what can be done? The first step is to recognize myopia in our collective perspective on resource consumption as engineers, economists, policy-makers, and inhabitants of this planet. Classical valuation methods cannot account for these impacts, at least as long as they exist within an epistemology founded in growth as a positive property of human society rather than as a normative value.\nI hope to continue to examine these topics in greater depth, not for professional promotion (unlikely absent a large grant to build ecological philosophy widgets with my graduate students) but rather for personal edification and sanity. I would like to reflect on value systems, morality, and social change. I am also interested in teasing out the seeming intangibles of the engineering perspective on policy evaluation from the conventional economics-based approach, and how engineering has been drawn into the economics perspective through a lack of appropriate application of relevant theory and knowledge - e.g., entropy, biophysical limits, and system dynamics."

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website at sta210-s22.github.io/website.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Sakai, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course forum Conversations. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Conversations before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “STA 210” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STA 210 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.",

Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.

    "text": "Assessment\nAssessment for the course is comprised of six components: application exercises, homework assignments, labs, exams, projects, and teamwork.\n\nApplication exercises\nParts of some lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59 pm ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be three, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content, and they may also include small analysis and computational tasks. The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

    "title": "Syllabus",
    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel and our head TA Rick Presman before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board.",

We can write this as \\(y = A \\times 2^{(x-1900)/50}\\), where \\(A = 1.5 \\times 10^9\\)\nEquivalently, \\(y = A \\times e^{0.014(x-1900)}\\) meaning that y increases by 1.014 per year, or 1.15 per 10 years, or 4.0 per hundred years (\\(e^{1.4} = 4.0 = 400\\%\\) increase)\n\\(ln(y) = a + b ln(x)\\) represents power law growth (if \\(b &gt; 0\\)) or decline (if \\(b &lt; 0\\)) -&gt; \\(y = A x^b\\)"

    "text": "Example: Sports Viewing & Political Attitudes\nConsider the below article excerpt (based on an article in a leading psychology journal):\nMany people watch UNL Cornhusker football games. Whereas research finds that Cornhuskers viewing influences Nebraskans’ mating preferences, we propose that it might also change their political and religious views. Building on theory suggesting that political and religious orientation are linked to viewing preference, we test how football season influenced Nebraskans’ politics, religiosity, and voting in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In two studies with large and diverse samples, whether it was football season had drastically different effects on single versus married Nebraskans. Football season led single Nebraskans to become more liberal, less religious, and more likely to vote for Barack Obama. In contrast, football led married Nebraskans to become more conservative, more religious, and more likely to vote for Mitt Romney. In addition, football-induced changes in political orientation mediated Nebraskans’ voting behavior. Overall, the football season not only influences Nebraskans’ politics, but appears to do so differently for single versus married Nebraskans."

    "text": "Some general feedback on project report 1:\n\nWhen interpreting models always think about the following questions:\n\nDo the parameter signs make sense? E.g., more people in a household should make more trips.\nDo the parameter magnitudes make sense? E.g., more people in a household should make more trips, but it is unlikely an additional person will triple trips.\nDoes it make sense to include a variable in the model? E.g., do you expect proximity to playgrounds will affect work trips?\n\nWe talked about comparing model goodness-of-fit based on the \\(R^2\\) in class. The adjusted \\(R^2\\) provides a slightly better measure because it accounts for the number of parameters.\nSome groups did not adjust the cross-classification model to remove zero cells.\nYou should not treat a p-value as a binary include/exclude criteria. However, you should also avoid (or at least note) highly insignificant parameters. Statistical significance is more important in prediction tasks (e.g., trip generation forecasting) than policy analysis tasks (e.g., impacts of different variables on trip generation).\nWhile I ask that you submit a Jupyter notebook, you should still cleanup your notebook so it is clear and professional. This means using proper headings, full sentences, and removing analysis that does not contribute to the report narrative.\nCategorical variables use numerical codes, but these codes have no meaning. E.g., if race 1 is White and race 2 is Asian, how are we meant to interpret a change from race = 1 to race = 2? The correct treatment of categorical variables is to translate them into dummy/binary variables (0/1). We can define categories minus one such variables because parameters are always interpreted with respect to a reference. Eg., if we set race1 as the reference then a negative parameter for race2 means a person with that race is less likely to make a trip than a person of race1 type.\n\nThe following is a rough summary of the applicability of NHTS variables in a household-based trip generation model. Many variables are included in the table that may not be relevant but provide an illustration of the questions to ask yourself when reviewing variables for inclusion in a trip generation model.

Some of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities during lecture. You are expected to attend all lecture sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussions. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.

These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice applying the transportation planning concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within two days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Wednesday by 11:59 pm CT, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm CT.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete non-coding assignments. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be one final exam. Through this exam you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course. The exam will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content and it may also include small analysis tasks.\nFinal Exam Date & Time: Monday, Dec. 11 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. PKI 164 & NH W 213\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to a real-world dataset. The project will be completed with your teams, and each team will present their work in writing via deliverables due throughout the semester. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

Your TA and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TA, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and contribute to the team project.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, there are many resources available on-campus (e.g. CAPS). - I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

    "text": "Course Policies\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nAcademic honesty policy\nAcademic integrity is of the utmost importance at Nebraska. Be sure you understand expectations of you and your academic work. View the complete list of academic dishonesty violations in the Student Code of Conduct, specifically Article III: Proscribed Conduct, Section B. Conduct – Rules and Regulations, 1. Acts of Academic Dishonesty. For more information, please visit https://studentconduct.unl.edu/. If you are unsure what counts as academic dishonesty in this course, please visit me during office hours. The first instance of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero for the assignment or exam. The second incidence of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course.\n\n\nAccommodations for students with disabilities policy\nIt is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students. Reasonable accommodations are provided for students who are registered with the Accessibility Services Center and make their requests sufficiently in advance. For more information, contact: Lincoln campus: [Services for Students with Disabilities] (https://www.unl.edu/ssd/) Omaha campus: [Accessibility Services Center] (https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/inclusion/disability-services/students/index.php)\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the [course website] (https://unl-hawkins-lab.github.io/Hawkinslab/teaching/CIVE461/CIVE461.html).\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas - make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course forum Canvas Discussions. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Conversations before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “CIVE 461” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to CIVE 461 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistant.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, ChatGPT) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for homework.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Jason Hawkins and our TA Omid Armantalab before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted by Canvas within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project deadline.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day. If you miss a lecture, make sure to communicate with your project team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nCell phone use and professional behavior\nWhen you come to class, your cell phone must be turned off or silenced and put away where it is not a distraction to you or anyone else. The instructor’s expectations for classroom behavior are based on the norms of the engineering profession. Questions and discussion related to class material are welcome and encouraged but respect for the instructor and fellow classmates is required at all times. No cell phone usage will be allowed during any exams.",

    "title": "EV Adoption in the US Midwest",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nTransportation is the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions source in the United States (28%). As such, reducing emissions from this sector is an important step towards addressing climate change impacts. One strategy to address this impact is the electrification of personal vehicles. In this study, we focus on electric vehicle (EV) adoption factors. Past studies on this topic have framed the vehicle adoption question around small vehicles. However, most Americans (60-70%) drive larger vehicles (i.e., SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks). Our goal in this study was to understand how attitudes about EV adoption vary across the population.\nThe core of the research study was a consumer survey administered to residents of Midwest states (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Design\nThe survey was administered in Qualtrics and distributed to 2,000 respondents in March, 2023 via an online panel company. Responses were screened for completion time and various other quality checks. After further post-completion quality controls, 1,954 complete responses were used in analysis. Respondent locations are shown below in an interactive map. Each respondent completed six stated preference experiments about their vehicle choice preferences. The available responses were “small car - gas”, “small car - electric”, “large car - gas”, “large car - electric”, “pickup truck - gas”, and “pickup truck - electric” where gas is an internal combustion engine vehicle and electric is a plugin electric vehicle. Additional details on the stated preference experiment are provided below.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nStated preference experiments are a standard approach in consumer analysis to examine the preference for discrete options, where one or more options may not be presently available. Our the case of vehicle ownership, electric pickup trucks have only recently entered the market. We first presented respondents with the following images to illustrate our vehicle class definitions, attempting to keep images generic and free of brand logos that might influence preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall car 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall car 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge car 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge car 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickup truck 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickup truck 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then presented respondents with a series of stated preference experiments. These experiments take the form of attribute tables. Respondents must select one option from among the six presented to them. Each option is described by its purchase price, fuel cost (per 100 miles), annual maintenance cost, tax rebeate, recharging time (at a station and at home), driving range (in miles), towing capacity (in lbs), and onboard generator capacity (in days of typical home demand). Most attributes were based on previous survey experiments. However, towing capacity and onboard generator capacity were added to the experiment as features relevant to pickup truck owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Findings\nThe survey provided a wealth of results to be explored by the research team. We present a few of these findings below, with additional analysis provided in forthcoming publications.\nFirst, looking at respondents’ expected next vehicle purchase there is an intuitive trend towards more large vehicles among larger households. Pickup truck preference appears to be relatively constant across household sizes.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive\\Documents\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\research\\projects\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:230: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

It is widely known in the transportation planning community that active mode (walking and cycling) trips are underreported in traditional data sources (e.g., the National Household Travel Survey in the U.S.). When asked about daily trips, survey respondents frequently do not report recreational active mode trips, such as walking the dog around the block. We had the hypothesis that a similar under-reporting may occur among rural residents who use their personal vehicles on their property. This travel may be important for these residents when considering an EV, as it will deplete the vehicle battery (and therefore driving range). For example, a rancher may drive their pickup truck on their property to check on cows and then drive into town. Prior surveys likely missed this travel, resulting in an under-reporting of rural travel. The question was worded as follows: How often do you use your vehicle off public roads for work purposes (e.g., on your property or private roads)? after an initial screening question for whether the respondent makes such trips.\nAs expected, we found that those working in the farming, fishing, and foresty sectors are the most likely to travel off public roads for work. Further, they are the most likely to make such trips at least once per week. We also found a high rates for government and construction workers. Government workers may be driving in parks or to perform inspections on farms or industrial sites. Management and professional works also report making off-road trips. These trips may include engineers and other professional employees visiting farm, forestry, and industrial work sites. However, our main finding is significant travel that we do not believe is reported on conventional travel surveys (e.g., the NHTS).\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive\\Documents\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\research\\projects\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:270: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

There interest in this case is whether pickup truck owners are more likely to make such trips. We find evidence for this hypothesis, but it is not as strong as we anticipated, with many car owners reporting that they make trips off public roads 1-3 times per month.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive\\Documents\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\research\\projects\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:319: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

The below figure summarizes these results by vehicle powertrain choice. We find that many people in the Midwest anticipate their next vehicle will have an internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain - i.e., be either gasoline or diesel. However, those who plan to purchase their next vehicle in greater than 4 years are more likely to buy a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Battery electric vehicle (BEV) purchase intention may grow to 20% but generally hovers around the current national average sales rate of 10%. This result indicates that current intention does not align with climate mitigation scenarios requiring widescale BEV adoption across the country.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive\\Documents\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\research\\projects\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:376: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

Parking access is a commonly cited barrier to EV adoption in prior research. We find that a large portion of the Midwest population (44.3%) have access to a private enclosed garage. There is a mix of other levels of access to potential home charging facilities. However, 17% of the population lacks a dedicated parking space and a further 12% rely on shared parking that could not accomodate EV charging equipment.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe following two figures are a special kind of diagram called a Sankey plot. Sankey plots are a great way to show shifts between two scenarios. The first Sankey plot shows current vehicle ownership (on the left) and stated vehicle choice in our stated preference experiment. The user can move the boxes around and use the slider below the plot to change the minimum flow (current -&gt; stated choice) to appear in the plot. We can see that most current small vehicle owners also pick this option in our experiment. Few current pickup truck owners pick BEV options in the stated preference experiment. We see the largest shift towards BEV options among current small car owners.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe second Sankey plot shows the relationship between current vehicle ownership and the expected next vehicle purchase. Interestingly, here we see a smaller share of people selecting BEV options than in our experiments. The largest shifts are between vehicle sizes for ICE powertrain vehicles.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nOur initial results suggest that rural travel may be under-reported in conventional statistics due to travel on personal property and private roads for work purposes. This under-reporting will affect the viability of EV adoption in these areas because residents will face driving range factors not properly incorporated into existing analyses. We designed a novel stated preference experiment focused on electric pickup truck adoption. Our initial analysis indicates that electrification in this vehicle market will be slower than among small car owners.\nFurther work will involve more advanced modeling methods and scenario analysis. These results will be published to the website in August 2023.\nWe welcome feedback and suggestions for further analysis using our survey. We provide the complete survey as a pdf below.

This algorithm clusters observations (in our case users) in order to maximize the cross-cluster variation in the input features. Our features are defined by the variables described above. We use siloutte analysis to find the optimal number of clusters. The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an observation is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. Our results suggest the that four clusters are ideal here.\n\n\nFor n_clusters = 2 The average silhouette_score is : 0.4653705024493721\nFor n_clusters = 3 The average silhouette_score is : 0.48854051475775756\nFor n_clusters = 4 The average silhouette_score is : 0.5065985416901237\nFor n_clusters = 5 The average silhouette_score is : 0.4497914115339878\nFor n_clusters = 6 The average silhouette_score is : 0.4615478858524191",

    "text": "Overview: Non-motorized transportation modes, such as walking and biking, have gained increased popularity due to the benefits of physical activity, health, psychological well-being, leisure, and improved environmental quality. Walking and biking can be facilitated or constrained by the physical form of communities in general as well as transportation system in particular. Therefore the development of walkable and bikeable environment is one effective way to encourage active living and healthy community. Increasingly, local governments are considering how community design and transportation system will impact residents’ active and healthy life style. The motivation of the research is to enhance pedestrian and bicyclist safety with emerging active travel data. The main objective of the project is to develop a reliable methodology for measuring pedestrian and bicyclist exposure and analyzing associated risks.

A key pathway to decarbonization for the sector is electrification of the private vehicle stock. This pathway is particularly important in rural areas, where transit and land use planning are less feasible options. Rural residents generally drive further than their urban counterparts, while facing a relative deficit in infrastructure investments.Many households remain hesitant to purchase an EV due to “range anxiety” and a lack of available charging infrastructure. On the other hand, both public and private sector actors are reticent to invest in infrastructure without a known demand source. The problem is often termed a “chicken and egg” scenario because EV purchases and charging infrastructure are co-dependent. This project has several research thrusts. 1. EV & EVSE relationship - using an historical database of vehicle purchases by county for the United States, we are examing the causal relationship between EV purchases and charging infrastructure investments. 2. Electric pickup truck adoption - much of the current vehicle US fleet comprises large vehicles, including pickup trucks. These vehicle owners are unlikely to downsize their vehicle in order to own an EV. Many pickup truck owners, particularly outside large metro areas, also have utilitarian requirements for their personal vehicles. We are developing surveys, and associated discrete choice models, to ascertain the effect of these needs on the propensity to own an EV and associated range considerations.  3. Rural EV adoption - Related to the second research thrust, we are taking a deeper dive into the needs of rural residents for EV adoption.

But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of Python for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the Python packages we’re using in the course. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the VS codespace we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install Python 3.9\nDownload and install an IDE, such as Anaconda, Visual Studio Code, etc.\nInstall any necessary packages with conda install or pip install depending on your setup\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course.

That is your term project.\nThe project task is for you to use aggregate and disaggregate transportation planning methods to develop a 4-step travel demand model for a US metropolitan area of your choice. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a real-world dataset to analyze it in a meaningful way.\nAll analyses must be done in Python or R, and all components of the project must be reproducible.\n\nLogistics\nThis assignment will be performed in groups of 3-4 students. Groups will be chosen by the instructor to include a mix of programming skill levels and to match other metrics.\nThe primary deliverables for the project are a series of written, reproducible reports detailing your analysis.",

The core code is provided to you, but you MUST make modifications to the models and provide descriptive text, as outlined in the below subsections.\n\nRequirements and recommendations for reports 1, 2, and 3\n\nYou should submit a single *.ipynb file with the name “G[01,02,03]-NAMES.ipynb”. Please replace “NAMES” with the names of your team members.\nThe submitted notebook file should have a professional format and include sections headers (using #, ##, ###, etc. in markdown).\nFigures should be included as deemed necessary by the group. Tutorials are provided in the VS codespace on figure generation.\nYou will have to perform some additional data filtering and manipulation tasks. Tutorials are provided in the VS codespace on how to conduct these tasks. Additional documentation is available on the Pandas webpage.\nThe course instructor and TA are available to answer coding and modeling questions. Please make maximal use of office hours.\nThis is a group project, so you should make use of your team members. Some students may be stronger in coding, while others may have a firmer grasp of the statistics. You are encouraged to make use of these skills and learn from one another.\nYou may want to split into sub-teams to estimate models, then come together to compare your results. Such operational details are ultimately up to the individual groups. However, all group members must review the submission in its entirety and approve the results.\n\n\n\nGeneral file structure\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project tasks and data. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model, including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\n\nResults\nIn this section, you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics.\nThis section also includes initial interpretations and conclusions drawn from the model.\n\n\n\nAdditional resources in VS codespace\n\nCodebook_v1.2.xlsx: This file details the variable definitions for the NHTS dataset.\nNHTS2017_UsersGuide_04232019_1.pdf: This file details the process for conducting the NHTS and how to use the data.\nPython tutorials: Additional tutorial files are provided detailing how to use various Pandas features, how to generate charts, and many other useful features.

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final models; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your study area from statistical analysis and literature review. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written reports/Jupyter notebooks.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 15 pages.\nPoints for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written reports/Jupyter notebooks. The Jupyter notebooks should be neatly organized and interpretable to a knowledgeable reader.",

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Gary Becker begins his “A Theory of the Allocation of Time” (Becker 1965) with a discussion of time spent at work relative to other activities, highlighting the need for more robust analyses of uncompensated time use in economics. Little did he know that his theory and model structure would strongly influence travel behaviour and economic analysis over subsequent decades. In the 1970s, DeSerpa (1971) and Evans (1972) provided among the first connections to transportation analysis. Building from DeSerpa and Evans, Jara-Díaz (2003) completed fundamental work on the value of time in transportation economics. However, there is a wealth of other insights relevant to transportation analysis to be gained from Becker’s theory. I will focus on the topic of transportation service provision.\nBeing a founder of the neoclassical “Chicago School of Economics”, Becker would certainly have strong opinions on the extension of his theory to include other non-market means of production. Nonetheless, one can consider four basic forms of production: market, home, government, and commons. Market production is the exchange of a good or service for money. Home production, as defined by Becker, is uncompensated production by the household (e.g., making dinner, cleaning the bathroom, etc.). The latter two forms of production were not discussed by Becker in his 1965 paper. In the first form, government produces a good or service for use by the public, financed by tax revenue or similar sources. For example, most healthcare services in the United States are privatized and subject to market forces, whereas many other nations provide healthcare as a public service. The final form of production is in the commons. Neoclassical economic theory suggests that common resources will be exploited if not managed by state intervention or market forces via monetization. However, both Mariana Mazzucato (2018) and Elinor Ostrom (1990) provide compelling arguments for the efficient use of common production. As one example, Wikipedia is managed in the commons as most contributors provide their services at no cost.\nThe reader may wonder: what does any of this have to do with travel behaviour? I argue that the above economic production framework can be mapped onto the transportation mode choice problem and provides valuable insights for behavioural theory and modelling methods. Home production of transportation takes the form of walking, cycling, or using one’s own vehicle. The vehicle and fuel must be purchased on the market, but the transportation service is provided by the household using personal time as the only input to production. In contrast, taxi or ridehail modes are purchased in the market from private firms (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Didi, etc.). Government provides transportation as a public service through transit. Transportation provided in the commons is less common (a nice little pun) but takes the form of carsharing and other systems wherein the service cost is shared among a pool of otherwise unaffiliated households. Each of the above transportation alternatives could manifest as the same physical mode – i.e., a small passenger vehicle. However, the behavioural and operational models differ. For example, a person may be unable to afford market production (ridehail). They may not use public production (transit) to avoid sharing a vehicle with strangers. They may be unwilling to participate in the commons (carshare) because they don’t want someone’s muddy boots in their car.\nBeing trained as a civil engineer, I am always keen to find concrete (two puns in one article is the limit) applications for theory. The modelling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) provides an application of the above theory to transportation. Many scholars make the distinction between personal AVs, shared AVs (or SAVs) provided as a public service, and SAVs provided in the market. However, in my reading, there is minimal thought given to how these operating models would function from an economic production theory perspective. Let us first focus on the first alternative. It is unclear whether to classify a personal AV as home production or market consumption – Is sitting comfortably in a vehicle while it performs the driving task pure leisure? Are you purchasing driving services in the market as a software package? The latter two alternatives provide an interesting contrast. In both cases, SAVs are provided to the household as a service. However, if we consider transportation as a public service, another economic concept may be brought to bear, termed private provision of a public good by Bergstrom et al. (1986) . Public transit provides a subsidized travel option for low-income households and those who choose not to own a personal vehicle. The widescale deployment of SAV fleets would therefore require ridehailing operators to take on this role. The risk is that each operator may rely on other operators to serve low-income households, with the result being a Nash equilibrium that does not maximize total social utility. Government intervention is necessary to ensure an equitable distribution of mobility through incentives or regulations (Sieg 2020). Existing simulations often ignore the profit-seeking motives of private operators, assuming they match trips to minimize detour time and are agnostic to traveller income and profit maximization motives on the part of operators.\nAs a final thought on the historical distinction between private and public travel modes. The marginal private automobile trip tends to add travel time for existing travellers through congestion that slows travel speed and increases its variability. In contrast, the marginal transit trip tends to improve service for existing travellers through reduced vehicle headways and the use of higher-order transit (i.e., trains rather than buses). The latter outcome is termed as an anti-congestion effect (Mohring 1972). The trend in SAV research is toward small, automobile-style, vehicles that may be shared or used alone. This shift adds shades of gray to the public-private dichotomy. Will shared mobility exhibit the congestion effect of fthe private automobile or the anti-congestion effect of transit? Importantly, in which contexts do these new forms of mobility tend to exhibit each of these effects (i.e., there is likely a spectrum of possible impacts depending on the application of technology, local built form, and transportation infrastructure conditions)?"

    "title": "William Vickrey and Transportation Economics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "William Vickrey made major contributions to a wide range of fields within the economics discipline and was recognized for his work with 1996 Nobel Prize in Economic Science. Many of his contributions fall within my interests of Urban and Transportation Economics, so I thought it worthwhile to review a few of his publications. He also happens to be the only Nobel Laureate, of which I am aware, who was borne in my home province of British Columbia. My focus will be on his work in marginal cost pricing, specifically his article “Congestion Theory and Transport Investment”, which was published in American Economic Review in 1969. This is among the first discussions of congestion pricing. His focus is on measures to relieve congestion, and the efficient allocation of public investment towards this objective. He suggests that investment does not sufficiently consider the marginal cost, and may therefore misrepresent consumer surplus as a metric for investment benefit.\nVickrey was one of those great geniuses who, in an off-hand comment, makes insights that would form the basis for an entire paper by others. One such case is that of bus headway, which he argued to be optimally related to demand by a square root relationship - to be proven analytically by Gordon Newell at UC Berkeley a few years later. Vickrey assumes delay to vary by the square of total volume, with no indication of an empirical reference point. This forms a cornerstone of his theory of traffic congestion. On average, a vehicle will inflict an amount of delay on other vehicles equal to the delay experienced by itself.\nThe principle situation of delay considered by Vickrey is what he terms a bottleneck. This is an instance of a segment of roadway that has a lower capacity than its upstream and downstream adjacent segments. The bottleneck is typically a function of a reduction in the number of travel lanes due to an accident or geometric constraint (e.g. bridge or road narrowing). Vickrey recognizes this is an atypical form of congestion, but argues for its tractable setup for analytical analysis of costs and measures of welfare.\nHe considers the example of a bottleneck on a roadway with a demand for travel of N = 7,200 commuters. It is assumed that their departure from the bottleneck is distributed uniformly over a period between \\(t_a = 08:00\\) and \\(t_b = 09:00\\). The critical capacity can be defined as\n\\[ v_m = \\frac{N}{t_b - t_a} = 120\\, veh/min \\label{eq:mc1} \\]\nIf the capacity of the bottleneck is smaller than \\(v_m\\), then it is impossible for all the commuters to reach their destinations at their desired arrival times. Some of the commuters will arrive at their destinations close to their arrival time, but will be required to stay in the queue for a longer time. While those who push their arrival time away from the desired arrival time, will spend relatively less time in the queue, but experience a penalty through time spent at home when they desire to be at their destination (or, if not desire, lose pay).\nVickrey makes a set of assumptions about value of time (VOT), which initially confused me on the basis of disutility of time - until I realized that they described activities with positive utility parameters. He defines the value of time spent at home at \\(w_h = 2\\, cents/min\\), time spent at work before the desired starting time at \\(w_o = w_p = 1\\, cent/min\\), and time spent at work after the desired starting time at \\(w_o = w_j = 4\\, cents/min\\). This means that, before the desired starting time, a person would rather be at home (greater VOT), while they would rather be at work after the desired start time. This tends to assume a wage of 2 cents per minute above the VOT for leisure (i.e. time spent at home). Time spent in the queue is valued at \\(w_q = 0\\, cents/min\\). With these monetary conditions, a fraction of commuters, \\(r = \\frac{2}{3}\\), will pass through the queue during queue development. The time of maximum queue size will occur at \\(t_p = 08:40\\), subjective to the above prices. Vickrey specifies a linear relationship for the queue size, producing a triangular shape in time and queue size, with a maximum at time \\(t_p\\). He suggests that a dynamic price structure be set, which eliminates the queue. The toll is set to zero at \\(t_i\\) and rises to a maximum, given by\n\\[ p_p = \\frac{Nr}{v}(w_h - w_p) = \\frac{4800}{v} \\label{eq:mc2} \\]\nat \\(t_p\\), before falling to zero at \\(t_j\\). Commuters will leave their home at a time, such that they leave the location of the bottleneck at the same time they would leave the queue absent prices. This will distribute commuters throughout the time period in a more even manner, such that no queue forms and no commuter would be better off changing their departure time, in terms of VOT and congestion toll.\nAn interesting aspect to this result is that it has a net neutral effect from the perspective of the commuter, but produces additional revenue for the local government agency levying the toll. Revenue from the toll could be used to offset an existing flat toll or invested in long-term infrastructure improvements (e.g. transit or capacity expansion). Vickrey extends his study through empirical analysis of the results, consideration of alternative routes, and variation in the VOT. He provides some interesting commentary on the assessment of investments in new infrastructure. He argues that many of the new routes put forth at the time of publication based their benefit measures on increased speeds and flow volumes. These are not accurate measures of benefits to the user because they are frequently circuitous routes and do not decrease overall travel time. Vickrey argues for the application of congestion pricing as a policy lever in the cost-benefit analysis. The inclusion of such a measure would give a more accurate picture of the monetized improvement in travel time.\nVickrey published “The City as a Firm” in the proceedings of a conference held by the International Economic Association in 1977. The significance of this work is its early development of concepts of New Economic Geography. Vickrey identifies the importance of transportation costs and economies of scale as model inputs. The absence of transportation costs represents a futuristic notion of instantaneous movement of goods and persons. Vickrey defines economies of scale in this context as positive neighbourhood effects. This is a measure of the efficiency of proximity. If each activity could be carried out efficiently within small shops, then production could be uniformly spread throughout a region without loss of efficiency. Evidence has found neither to be the case and this is an important point in the context of autonomous vehicles (AV). They are often touted as significantly reducing transportation costs, but this argument fails on two counts. Based on the arguments of Vickrey, this argument fails to recognize the structural importance of scale economies. Such effects are wholly unaffected by the introduction of AV and economic efficiency will outweigh any desire to relocate activities to more dispersed locations. Vickrey discusses the importance of natural features in the location of our largest cities, while also recognizing that their size would be far smaller in the absence of economies of scale.\nA related publication, in the context of the effect of AV adoption on city formation, is the book “Peak Car: the Future of Travel” by Professor David Metz at UCL. He provides a strong argument for hard limits on the speed of travel within an urbanized region. Metz argues that average commuting time has an equilibrium about 30 minutes, going back to the dawn of human civilization. While not a new argument, it is an important one and has been largely overlooked in the AV literature. These vehicles have the potential to introduce marginal increases in travel speed and therefore travel distance, but this 30 minute threshold will likely remain. Transportation costs will remain a factor in the formation and development of urban regions.\nVickrey assumes a perfect market in developing a model of the city as a firm but recognizes this is not an ideal assumption. Dixit and Stiglitz published their monopolistic competition model in the same year, which led to the NEG work of Krugman in the following decades (for which he scored himself a Nobel)."

    "title": "Socialist Calculation Debate",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I once had a student call me a socialist for discussing equity in a transportation engineering course. While somewhat humourous and avoiding any tangential discussions on the topic of transportation equity (Cole’s notes: engineers definitely need to consider it), they were not wrong that my beliefs on many topics tend towards Democratic Socialism. What I would like to discuss today is Socialist Calculation Debate.\nThe Socialist Calculation Debate was a debate among economists, beginning in the 1920s, in response to the rise of socialism in Eastern Europe. Von Mises and Hayek argued that socialism was not feasible because it lacked an appropriate means of economic valuation - the law of value. While often framed as a debate between capitalist and socialist economic systems, the debate included internal differences among socialist economists as to the use of markets and money.\nThis debate interests me in the context of my work on the valuation of ecosystem services. I do not go so far as to say that markets have no value. Within the traditional economic market, price signals are an effective structural mechanism. The issue comes when we extend a system of values developed within the market economy to the wider environment. For a start, we are more than cogs in an economic machine. Thus, our systems of valuation must be more than those employed by the economic market. How to measure value beyond money is certainly a germane question. So how should we do it? I do not have a clear answer. I do not believe this is by definition a statement that we should not pursue answers! In fact, as argued by Thomas Kuhn, it is not always through incremental progress that we achieve innovation. Rather, we must seek out new ways of thinking and analysis. I increasingly find my lack of formal training in economics an asset in that I am unimpeded by a linear training on the subject, to the great consternation of all my economic committee members as a student (“but those aren’t the correct papers to reference!”).\nValue theory is the ethical study of how, why, and to what degree we values things. Ecological econmics distinguishes two types of value: donor-type and receiver-type value. We can think of these value types in terms of physical flow accounting. Donor-type value parallels the attribution of physical flows to their point of production (i.e., resource extraction). Receiver-type value parallels the attribution of physical flows to their points of consumption (i.e., households). Odum uses the term emergy to described the embodied energy required for provision of a good or service. Emergy is typically measured in sun energy equivalents - i.e., the sun energy required to produce a fuel, good, or human service. It provides a measure of the quality of energy with respect to their ability to support receiver-type value. As an alternative to monetary value, emergy has many appeals features for the engineering trained in thermodynamics. It does not introduce any artificial distortions of value induced by market fluctuations or rent seeking behaviour.\nWe can also distinguish between instrumental and intrinsic value, as described by Plato in the Republic. An instrumentally valuable good is one that has value for its provisioning of other valued goods or services - i.e., what a transportation might call a derived demand good. Intrinsically valuable goods have value in their use. The two are not mutually exclusive. In environmental ethics, we can consider the instrumental value of resources for humans, such as the value of forests for their provision of timber used in dwellings. However, forests also have an intrinsic value in their direct provision of beauty. Environmental economics would seek to weigh the tradeoffs between these values - i.e., is the loss of the intrinsic beauty of a forest by cutting down a tree balanced by its instrumental value as an input to economic production. The issue that arises here is that instrumental value is quite easy to quantify in an economic value system. We can simply measure the direct economic benefits. However, intrinsic value is a bit squishier to use the technical term. Does removing a single tree affect the ascetics? What about single stand of trees? Are there ecological impacts from discontinuity in habitats that will affect the intrinsic value of adjecent remaining forested areas? How much is nature beauty worth to us?\nAt this time, I would like to thank my family for reading these ramblings. I assume no one else will see them aside from a few of my students with the misfortune to click on the wrong page on our research website.\nAs an aside, the raised fist image has a long history as a social symbol. Extent examples include a painting by Honor'e Daumier from the 1848 French Revolution. On a visit to the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture, I was struck by a group of young African American students posed by a statue commemorating the 1968 Olympics Black Power salute. On the topic of value, it is interesting to observe the shifting patterns and values of a symbol change over time as they are adapted by different groups."

    "title": "Emergy and States",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Howard T. Odum was an American ecologist and systems theorist. He developed the principles of emergy beginning in the 1950s in response to an inadequate representation of the quality variation among various forms of energy. Emergy is defined as the amount of energy consumed in direct and indirect transformations for the production of a product or service. Its standard unit is the emjoule, measured in a consistent form of energy (typically solar energy). Emergy is then a measure of the amount of solar energy required to produce a particular energy source.\nI found the concept a bit opaque based on the Wikipedia page. The International Association for the Advacement of Emergy provides a nice example that helped me understand the idea. Consider a log. The available energy in the log is the heat it can provided through the process of its combustion. Its emergy is measured as the required input energy through sunlight and transpiration to grow the tree, harvest the tree, and process that tree into a log (and other contributions for it to reach your home). We can think of emergy as an input measurement equivalent to the energy output we typically consider in analysis. The objective inherent in emergy is to provide a consistent comparison between the usefulness of different products or services, as well as their energy efficiency. For example, the energy in a log measured in Joules is not readily comparable to that embodied in human metabolism because they do not produce comparable outputs (heating in the case of a log and heat, movement, and various other outputs in the case of human metabolism). Emergy lets us consider the inputs in a common unit based on the required solar energy.\nA nice metric we can derive from emergy is transformity, measured as the remaining energy in the product compared with its input energy - measured in se/J. From the second law of thermodynamics, we know that available energy decreases with each transformation. However, the emergy at the start of the process will remain fixed. As a result, the transformity (se/J) of the remaining available energy tends to increase with each transformation - more emergy is required per unit of energy. This makes sense to me if we consider progressive steps down the line. For example, the emergy required for a unit of human metabolism will be a function of the conversion rate of food energy into human energy; food production will require some energy from fertilizers, water, transportation, etc.; each of these products will require some amount of energy from electricity, sunlight, etc.; and so on. A given quantity of energy produced via human metabolism will require a greater input of solar energy (emergy) than a similar quantity of energy for fertilizer, as there are energy loses along the intermediate steps and inputs to human metabolism that are separate from its fertilizer requirements.\nAnother concept I’d like to write about today is the steady state economy. The idea here is that an economy can be defined that is constant in its population and capital stocks. I was reminded of this concept while reviewing a chapter of the Nebraska Climate Plan today. They discussed the idea of “sustainable growth”. By including the term “growth”, the discussion is already framed in a context of non-steady state sustainability. If we consider the IPAT equation (Impact = Population x Affluence x Technology), “sustainable growth” requires that technology play an inordinate role to ensure stable, or preferably declining impacts, because neither population nor affluence are held at steady state conditions. The growth mindset is unfortunately baked into many analyses. We see it in IEA/EIA forecasts - not just growing population but growth of the “good things” (renewables, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, etc.) into the future. The only variation is by how much these various quantities are assumed to grow. Even the paragon of capitalist economics, Adam Smith, believed national economies would reach stationary conditions. Herman Daly, a prominent ecological economists, argued for a steady state economy, based on natural resource flows, that would impose hard limits on resource use. This view differs from the classical view beginning with Smith, which believed that conditions would evolve without government intervention. While Daly’s approach seems restrictive and infeasible in a democratic society, I also believe it naive to assume that stationarity will naturally evolve as a function of standard market evolution. In my work, I am starting to examining these views from a microeconomic perspective through econometric model estimation. While not a perfect solution to the forecasting problem inherent in the discussion, this approach does allow us to operationalize various steady state mechanisms as simulations based upon empirical data and structural behavioural assumptions."

    "title": "AV Deployment, Urban DNA, and Equity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Written before starting my Ph.D. in 2017 (July 03, 2017)…\nMany questions arise for the transportation-land use modeller with the prospect of autonomous vehicles. Its effect on urban form will be heavily influenced by the manner in which it is implemented. It is probable AV will become a ubiquitous replacement of our current auto fleet, but may not be placed under personal ownership. One alternative would be a public fleet of vehicles. This has the advantage of being controlled by a single entity with a history of managing shared mobility services. Given the rapid emergence of the technology and its beginning in the private sector via automobile and technology firms, it is also likely for AV to be implemented as a set of competing services, similar to Uber and Lyft. This has advantages from the perspective of competition leading to innovation, but raises equity concerns. In addition, by placing the means of transport into private hands, there are concerns raised about privatization of infrastructure, etc. The final alternative would be a simple replacement of private automobiles, with personal ownership of each AV. These alternative implementations have the potential to influence the impact of AV on urban form.\nMy thoughts on this matter are concentrated on representing these alternative implementations in an integrated modelling framework. Do existing model frameworks have the capacity to model such changes, or are new methods required? The LUTI modelling field developed within a relatively stable transport system (i.e. the private automobile paradym). There is likely a need for increased dynamics in models. Rather than examining the impacts on demand of the introduction of a new interchange, we are interested in the changes in urban form resulting from a change in transportation supply and associated changes in demand. Alan Wilson is one of the founders of spatial interaction models and continues to develop innovative ideas with regards to dynamics in urban systems and their basic form. One of th concepts he considers is the idea of an urban ‘DNA’ and introduction of concepts from biological evolution into urban modelling. These types of concepts are critical in the development of models with the ability to consider seemingly large deviations from our current systems of transport. This requires a concept of fundamental rules of urban formation and growth to be operationalized in the model and not allowing oneself to be constrained by current transportation modes, etc.\nOne of the structures attributed to the introduction of the private automobile is urban sprawl, but to the history nerd this form appears long before. Without dipping too deep into history, we can see similar forms in the country estates of 18th century Britain. The ‘London Season’ was a time of the year when these nobles and other wealthy property owners would come into the city for a time to meet and put together marriages. We seem to have a natural, in our DNA, preference for solitude and personal space. Conversely, we also require proximity for social engagement, even with our rapidly developing communication technologies. Increased wealth among the middle classes has brought the ability to own a small ‘estate’ within the grasps of the every man, suggesting urban sprawl is not only a function of the automobile, but an ingrained desire that became possible through increased wealth. In the context of AV, I wonder what ingrained, DNA-based, desires and preferences will manifest themselves in our urban form. I perceive a need for better longitudinal data analysis, rather than close calibration to data from the current year. Rather than forcing the spatial structures of today onto the model, we should focus on dynamics and long-term trends. I have more confidence in the stability of the human mind than a concrete overpass with a 50 year design life, built 40 years ago. We must look to analogy in the phyical sciences in physics and biological DNA, but remember we humans are complex and dynamic systems. We should also be considering the latest concepts in economics and psychology. We must not allow ourselves to be pulled into the stream of past models, but let them guide us.\nWritten at the start of my Ph.D. (Nov. 27, 2017)…\nOne aspect of AV, which has not be sufficiently assessed is the issue of social equity. Mobility is a key factor in determining social mobility (excuse the word-play) and there is strong evidence for transportation investment/quality being strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of income groups. In terms of transit usage, higher income groups tend to take fixed rail transit over bus. This has resulted in the subway map of many cities displaying a strong resemblance with income maps (see for example this CityLab article). Transportation comprises about 30% of household expenses for the poorest of North Americans.\nThis brings us to the case of AV. Some believe this innovation will be unequivocally good for equity. They expect vehicle prices to fall and anticipate implementation as a shared mobility-as-a-service system. The thinking is that the sharing of the cost of a ride will decrease the marginal cost of a trip and lower the access cost for lower income households. The cost of ownership will be shared between users and the removal of the driving task will drastically lower operating costs relative to taxis. This line of thinking is in contrast with some fundamental principles of economics that I will discuss below.\nFirst, we must consider that this proposed service will have substantial sunk cost research associated with it. Technology development is expensive and we are not looking at a government agency, which will utilize tax revenues to pursue research for public benefit. These are large publically held corporations, with the mandate of maximizing shareholder revenue. Absent of government intervention via subsidies, initial AV trips will be expensive and available to the wealthy. Rudimentary microeconomics states that this is the path of any non-inferior good: consumption will increase with increasing available capital.\nI would like to provide an example to structure the argument. Consider a vehicle with capacity for 5 occupants. A firm can choose to 1) charge $1 for each passenger in order to provide a service available to all residents of the city or 2) charge $4 for each passenger, knowing that a large segment of the population will be excluded from the service. In order for case 1 to govern, the firm must be certain of at least 4 passengers for each trip. As a risk averse agent, the firm will invariably decided to charge $4 knowing they only need to capture a single rider for each trip to break even with respect to case 1. Additional passengers will rapidly increase the profits of the firm beyond what could be provided under case 1. This brings us back to the issue of equity and its spatial component. If we assume that there is spatial segregation by income group (a very reasonable assumption), we can say that $4 trips will be concentrated in set of sub-regions within the city. We can consider a situation of $4 “trip signals” for a high income sub-region and $1 “trip signals” from a low income sub-region. The shared mobility operator, seeking to optimize their vehicle routing, will deploy the majority of their vehicles in areas where they can maximize their profits - a function of the demand for trips at the prevailing rate of service.\nAV and mobility-as-a-service raise questions about willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-share. Absent government input, these services will act solely based on market forces. Current patterns of auto ownership and usage suggest people would be willing to pay a substantial premium to avoid vehicle sharing. In a culture of 1.20 vehicle occupancies, can we consider shared mobility as a likely outcome? Profit seeking private vehicle operators will have no qualms about circulating vehicles through upper income communities where the highest premium can be gained for each trip. This will exclude lower income households from use of the service. Lower operating costs does not necessarily mean that prices will drop. The price of a trip will be a function of the willingness-to-pay for each person and the number of persons who are willing to pay a given price, that is aggregate demand. It may be the case that operators can maintain sufficient ridership at high prices and not require a lower price to draw in additional ridership. Each vehicle will still constitute a capital cost and firms will seek to maximize unit (vehicle) profit and technology costs will be high for each vehicle.\nI do not argue that prices will not come down eventually, but the risk is that during the period of partial AV penetration barriers will form that exclude, or inhibit, the adoption of this new mobility tool by lower income households. Consideration of equity in transportation and land use model forecasts will be critical in informing government policy to mitigate these effects. I have seen the effects of transportation on social exclusion through my travels in South America and even here in Canada and the United States. These considerations will be particularly important in developing cities, where government incentive structures may differ from what we see in North American cities. Work conducted with the PECAS model framework in Caracas, Venezuala has proven the ability of these tools to quantify the equity challenges of transportation policy. We need only examine the locations where AV testing is currently taking place to see the potential inequity in its service provision. Major testing is occuring in Palo Alto and other technology hubs, among Richard Florida’s Creative Class - engineers, software developers, and the like. AV adoption has the potential to alleviate issues of accessibility and inequity of access, but we cannot negate the possibility of it exacerbating these problems in an environment of market-driven mobility.\nSome final thoughts on the topic: How will luxury services affect access to AV? There is the potential for segregation of the market and higher quality services made available to those who can afford them. As infrastructure evolves to meet the needs of AV, I question whether this evolution will occur uniformly through the city or be focused in higher income communities where residents have the social capital to influence policy and the financial capital to become early adopters of the technology.\nWritten during my Ph.D. (Nov. 30, 2018)… A great source of inspiration in my thinking this past year has been the podcast EconTalk with Russ Roberts. This week Russ spoke with the Political Economist Michael Munger about his new book “Tomorrow 3.0: Transaction Costs and the Sharing Economy” and, more generally, the sharing economy. Their discussion raised some questions for me around my own research in transportation and land use. Michael placed great emphasis on the importance of transaction costs, which include and bear a close resemblance to transportation costs and accessibility. Michael defines transactions costs into three, conveniently ‘t-suffixed’ words, namely: triangulation, transfer, and trust. He gives the case of the Sears catalogue as an early 20th century example of reducing transaction costs. The catalogue provided a medium for the aggregation of a wide variety of goods for sale. The Sears catalogue can be argued to be a predecessor of Amazon. Both represented major leaps forward in our ability to reduce transaction costs. The goods are provided in a centralized location (fulfilling triangulation), low cost in their distribution networks (transfer), and trusted by consumers. The ability to rate suppliers is a key ingredient in the success of Amazon and, focusing on the shared economy, the emergence of software that provides a means of trust in non-traditional market transactions. Consider Uber, which provides a service similar to hitchhiking in its lack of regulation. Users trust the service because Uber acts as an intermediary system of vetting for drivers.\nMichael and Russ spend the first portion of the podcast talking about the sharing economy and the cost of durable goods. There are many goods we rarely use (e.g. power tools), which could be rented rather than owned. The main criteria for an effective shared durable good is that it have a high purchase price and low frequency of use. Michael provides an example of autonomous vehicles transporting rented equipment between homes, which is intriguing but also MIGHT presents challenges with respect to road congestion. I say might because it is not straightforward to compare individuals making purchases at the store with a centralized provider of goods, who can potentially optimize their route planning and carry many goods in a single vehicle. There are interesting questions around where the tradeoff lies between the cost of ownership and the cost of rental, including transportation costs.\nOne point that stood out for me in their discussion was the space requirement for durable goods. The primary examples are cars and large power tools. They discuss how space requirements for dwellings might be reduced by a diminished storage requirement within the home. Mind blown! It is so intuitive, but yet is not something I have considered at length. I am a great hoarder of books, which take up precious shelf space in our small apartment. The library is a (very) old example of the sharing economy in this particular space. I generally take advantage of this resource but the transaction costs are high for the cost of the good: I need to be sure the book is available at my local branch or reserve the book - requiring a wait for the satisfaction of reading a particular book. I’m often rough with my books, adding to my preference for ownership. None the less, it raises interesting questions about the reduction in building footprint associated with the shared ownership of cars, and perhaps other large durable goods.\nMichael and Russ talk about Uber being a framework for sharing, well outside the transportation realm. I think this evolution is highly probable and it raises some fascinating questions for transportation and land use researchers. These are fundamentally questions of transportation, accessibility, proximity, and time - in the parlance of my field. It is an exciting time to begin in this field, indeed!\nMy usual notes on these topics: how will these new technologies affect equity? How can new technologies be framed in the context of networks? This is a topic I am ruminating on as a potential book idea. I have an enormous passion for history, which is largely untapped in my research. I have been thinking a lot about topics for a book that mix my interest in history with the perspective of a Transportation Engineer. We shall see where it leads…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I was a child, my parents would read poetry to me. Statistically speaking, I don’t know the percent of engineering professors with this particular life experience, but I would hazard to guess it is small. One of my favourite poems was Robert Frost’s “The Road Not Taken”. The message I got from it was to pursue the path not taken, which I’d like to think I have taken forward in my life. I recently read Thomas Kuhn’s “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions”, one of those books that people like to say they read to sound intellectual but only skim a few pages then read the Wikipedia page - I read about 80% before skimming.\nOne of the key insights by Kuhn is that science differs from other fields in its linear treatment of innovation. That is, a scientific field reaches a divergence in the yellow wood and takes a single path. Kuhn characterizes the evolution of science in terms of general science and paradigm shifts. General science is the drudgery of research to make incremental advancements. Paradigm shifts are rare but move a field in a new direction. The key difference from other fields, at least according to Kuhn, is that the shift means a releasing of past ideas. After Einstein developed general relativity, Newtonian gravitation was deemed incomplete and a previous paradigm. While there may be a certain amount of competition among theories at a given time, there will ultimately be a winner.\nI think Kuhn is making an interesting insight, but I would also argue it’s largely a feature of fundamental physical sciences. To clarify his point, we can consider visual art. Cubism and Art Deco developed during the same period, but one did not subsume the other after vigorous discussion among artists. In art, multiple schools of thought can exist without raising questions of consistency. There are certainly debates about the merits of style and individuals are free to express their opinion about a particular piece of art, but revolution does not invalidate the continued pursuit of extent styles.\nIn my own field of travel behaviour, we often talk about modeling human behaviour as a mix of science and art. I think this rings true in the Kuhnian sense that parallel theories or approaches can coexist without being incongruent. When two roads diverge in the woods of behaviour, there is merit to pursuing both paths in order to get a fuller picture of behaviour. To come full circle, I recently read “Cosmic Wonder” by the young Canadian astronomer (from Victoria, BC - yes, my parents got me a signed copy) Nathan Hellner-Mestelman. It brought me back to my high school days reading pop science cosmology by Brian Greene and others. While I think Kuhn made some deep insights, I think physical sciences can also overstate its knowledge of the universe. They should also feel the freedom to pursue diverse paths, even if it diverges from the conventional wisdom and never leads to a paradigm shift. Of course, questions of consistency and equilibrium of thought (i.e., you cannot build on a scattered foundation) are important. We just need to not take ourselves too seriously as scientists and recognize we are all really artists - even if our fourth grade teacher told us we were no good at art."
