The assignment should be completed in groups of 2-3 persons. You may choose your own group. Your group does not need to be the same as prior assignments.\nThe assignment comprises two model estimation tasks:\n\nTrip Generation Model A dataset of total quarterly ridership of a transit service along an intercity corridor is available in MS Excel format. Develop a direct demand model for total ridership per quarter for each of the two transit services (economy class and 1st class) along this corridor. Please investigate the role of lag demand in the model. For estimation, you can use any software (MS Excel should be fine).\nOrdered Probability Model A dataset of bicycle users’ perceptions of the bike system/facilities for a city is available in MS Excel format. Please investigate their perception of overall quality of biking in the city through estimation of an ordered probability (either logit or probit) model. For estimation, you can use any software (functions are available in R, Python, Stata, etc.).\n\nYou may separate the two model tasks within your group or conduct all analyses as a group. All group members must contribute to the writing of the summary report.\nThe report should include at least the following sections: - Introduce the objective(s) and parts of the work. - Present the model formulation and justification of independent variables for each model task. - Selection of the best model specification (select one) for each model task. - Discuss the elasticities of independent variables of the final models.\nThe assignment deliverable should have the form of a professional report and should not be more than 10 pages (single-spaced).",

Whereas research finds that Cornhuskers viewing influences Nebraskans’ mating preferences, we propose that it might also change their political and religious views. Building on theory suggesting that political and religious orientation are linked to viewing preference, we test how football season influenced Nebraskans’ politics, religiosity, and voting in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In two studies with large and diverse samples, whether it was football season had drastically different effects on single versus married Nebraskans. Football season led single Nebraskans to become more liberal, less religious, and more likely to vote for Barack Obama. In contrast, football led married Nebraskans to become more conservative, more religious, and more likely to vote for Mitt Romney. In addition, football-induced changes in political orientation mediated Nebraskans’ voting behavior. Overall, the football season not only influences Nebraskans’ politics, but appears to do so differently for single versus married Nebraskans."

Some of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities during lecture. You are expected to attend all lecture sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussions. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.

These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice applying the transportation planning concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These AEs are due within two days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Monday lectures are due Wednesday by 11:59 pm CT, and AEs from Wednesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59 pm CT.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete non-coding assignments. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be one final exam. Through this exam you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course. The exam will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content and it may also include small analysis tasks.\nFinal Exam Date & Time: Monday, Dec. 11 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. PKI 164 & NH W 213\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to a real-world dataset. The project will be completed with your teams, and each team will present their work in writing via deliverables due throughout the semester. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.",

Your TA and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TA, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and contribute to the team project.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.",

I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, there are many resources available on-campus (e.g. CAPS). - I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

Be sure you understand expectations of you and your academic work. View the complete list of academic dishonesty violations in the Student Code of Conduct, specifically Article III: Proscribed Conduct, Section B. Conduct – Rules and Regulations, 1. Acts of Academic Dishonesty. For more information, please visit https://studentconduct.unl.edu/. If you are unsure what counts as academic dishonesty in this course, please visit me during office hours. The first instance of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero for the assignment or exam. The second incidence of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course.\n\n\nAccommodations for students with disabilities policy\nIt is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students. Reasonable accommodations are provided for students who are registered with the Accessibility Services Center and make their requests sufficiently in advance. For more information, contact: Lincoln campus: [Services for Students with Disabilities] (https://www.unl.edu/ssd/) Omaha campus: [Accessibility Services Center] (https://www.unomaha.edu/student-life/inclusion/disability-services/students/index.php)\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the [course website] (https://unl-hawkins-lab.github.io/Hawkinslab/teaching/CIVE461/CIVE461.html).\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas - make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course forum Canvas Discussions. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Conversations before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “CIVE 461” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to CIVE 461 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistant.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed; however, you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, ChatGPT) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for homework.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Jason Hawkins and our TA Omid Armantalab before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted by Canvas within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project deadline.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day. If you miss a lecture, make sure to communicate with your project team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nCell phone use and professional behavior\nWhen you come to class, your cell phone must be turned off or silenced and put away where it is not a distraction to you or anyone else. The instructor’s expectations for classroom behavior are based on the norms of the engineering profession. Questions and discussion related to class material are welcome and encouraged but respect for the instructor and fellow classmates is required at all times. No cell phone usage will be allowed during any exams.",

In the below figure, the term “features to be engineered” simply refers to combining and transforming variables to reduce the number of features and/or their correlation. As a hint, this study was chosen as an example of low-quality analysis. There may be no clear interpretation to a figure, and it is acceptable to state this conclusion.\n\n\nPlease comment on the validity of this procedure.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nTransportation is the largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions source in the United States (28%). As such, reducing emissions from this sector is an important step towards addressing climate change impacts. One strategy to address this impact is the electrification of personal vehicles. In this study, we focus on electric vehicle (EV) adoption factors. Past studies on this topic have framed the vehicle adoption question around small vehicles. However, most Americans (60-70%) drive larger vehicles (i.e., SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks). Our goal in this study was to understand how attitudes about EV adoption vary across the population.\nThe core of the research study was a consumer survey administered to residents of Midwest states (Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Design\nThe survey was administered in Qualtrics and distributed to 2,000 respondents in March, 2023 via an online panel company. Responses were screened for completion time and various other quality checks. After further post-completion quality controls, 1,954 complete responses were used in analysis. Respondent locations are shown below in an interactive map. Each respondent completed six stated preference experiments about their vehicle choice preferences. The available responses were “small car - gas”, “small car - electric”, “large car - gas”, “large car - electric”, “pickup truck - gas”, and “pickup truck - electric” where gas is an internal combustion engine vehicle and electric is a plugin electric vehicle. Additional details on the stated preference experiment are provided below.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nStated preference experiments are a standard approach in consumer analysis to examine the preference for discrete options, where one or more options may not be presently available. Our the case of vehicle ownership, electric pickup trucks have only recently entered the market. We first presented respondents with the following images to illustrate our vehicle class definitions, attempting to keep images generic and free of brand logos that might influence preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall car 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall car 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge car 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge car 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickup truck 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPickup truck 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then presented respondents with a series of stated preference experiments. These experiments take the form of attribute tables. Respondents must select one option from among the six presented to them. Each option is described by its purchase price, fuel cost (per 100 miles), annual maintenance cost, tax rebeate, recharging time (at a station and at home), driving range (in miles), towing capacity (in lbs), and onboard generator capacity (in days of typical home demand). Most attributes were based on previous survey experiments. However, towing capacity and onboard generator capacity were added to the experiment as features relevant to pickup truck owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary Findings\nThe survey provided a wealth of results to be explored by the research team. We present a few of these findings below, with additional analysis provided in forthcoming publications.\nFirst, looking at respondents’ expected next vehicle purchase there is an intuitive trend towards more large vehicles among larger households. Pickup truck preference appears to be relatively constant across household sizes.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive - University of Calgary\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\projects\\ev_adoption\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:230: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

It is widely known in the transportation planning community that active mode (walking and cycling) trips are underreported in traditional data sources (e.g., the National Household Travel Survey in the U.S.). When asked about daily trips, survey respondents frequently do not report recreational active mode trips, such as walking the dog around the block. We had the hypothesis that a similar under-reporting may occur among rural residents who use their personal vehicles on their property. This travel may be important for these residents when considering an EV, as it will deplete the vehicle battery (and therefore driving range). For example, a rancher may drive their pickup truck on their property to check on cows and then drive into town. Prior surveys likely missed this travel, resulting in an under-reporting of rural travel. The question was worded as follows: How often do you use your vehicle off public roads for work purposes (e.g., on your property or private roads)? after an initial screening question for whether the respondent makes such trips.\nAs expected, we found that those working in the farming, fishing, and foresty sectors are the most likely to travel off public roads for work. Further, they are the most likely to make such trips at least once per week. We also found a high rates for government and construction workers. Government workers may be driving in parks or to perform inspections on farms or industrial sites. Management and professional works also report making off-road trips. These trips may include engineers and other professional employees visiting farm, forestry, and industrial work sites. However, our main finding is significant travel that we do not believe is reported on conventional travel surveys (e.g., the NHTS).\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive - University of Calgary\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\projects\\ev_adoption\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:270: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

There interest in this case is whether pickup truck owners are more likely to make such trips. We find evidence for this hypothesis, but it is not as strong as we anticipated, with many car owners reporting that they make trips off public roads 1-3 times per month.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive - University of Calgary\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\projects\\ev_adoption\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:319: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

The below figure summarizes these results by vehicle powertrain choice. We find that many people in the Midwest anticipate their next vehicle will have an internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrain - i.e., be either gasoline or diesel. However, those who plan to purchase their next vehicle in greater than 4 years are more likely to buy a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Battery electric vehicle (BEV) purchase intention may grow to 20% but generally hovers around the current national average sales rate of 10%. This result indicates that current intention does not align with climate mitigation scenarios requiring widescale BEV adoption across the country.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\jfhaw\\OneDrive - University of Calgary\\group admin\\hawkins-tech-lab.github.io\\projects\\ev_adoption\\ev_adopt_graphs\\graphs.py:376: FutureWarning:\n\nSetting an item of incompatible dtype is deprecated and will raise in a future error of pandas.

Parking access is a commonly cited barrier to EV adoption in prior research. We find that a large portion of the Midwest population (44.3%) have access to a private enclosed garage. There is a mix of other levels of access to potential home charging facilities. However, 17% of the population lacks a dedicated parking space and a further 12% rely on shared parking that could not accomodate EV charging equipment.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe following two figures are a special kind of diagram called a Sankey plot. Sankey plots are a great way to show shifts between two scenarios. The first Sankey plot shows current vehicle ownership (on the left) and stated vehicle choice in our stated preference experiment. The user can move the boxes around and use the slider below the plot to change the minimum flow (current -&gt; stated choice) to appear in the plot. We can see that most current small vehicle owners also pick this option in our experiment. Few current pickup truck owners pick BEV options in the stated preference experiment. We see the largest shift towards BEV options among current small car owners.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe second Sankey plot shows the relationship between current vehicle ownership and the expected next vehicle purchase. Interestingly, here we see a smaller share of people selecting BEV options than in our experiments. The largest shifts are between vehicle sizes for ICE powertrain vehicles.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nOur initial results suggest that rural travel may be under-reported in conventional statistics due to travel on personal property and private roads for work purposes. This under-reporting will affect the viability of EV adoption in these areas because residents will face driving range factors not properly incorporated into existing analyses. We designed a novel stated preference experiment focused on electric pickup truck adoption. Our initial analysis indicates that electrification in this vehicle market will be slower than among small car owners.\nFurther work will involve more advanced modeling methods and scenario analysis. These results will be published to the website in August 2023.\nWe welcome feedback and suggestions for further analysis using our survey. We provide the complete survey as a pdf below.

    "text": "Can talk about axioms in math from book on Certainty to Uncertainty…\nSir Richard Stone (1913-91) some called the ‘father of national income accounting’ was leary of monetizing houehold labour when assessing it through the UN SNA reports. Thought it would be impossible to know how to do it because of lack of dat, and also social awkwardness of such a study. 70+ years on, there remains little theory that explains why homemakers should not be included in GDP. SNA developers have devised a different defence because although equivalent to work done by servants “by convention… only the wages of the domestic staff are treated as the value of output”. Invoke common sense and isolation from the market, difficulty of making economical estimation of the value of these activities. Awkward logic of GDP going up if we looked after each others children (see other places). Despite this apparent inability to value home production, the home itself is included in GDP accounts. In the United States, such ‘work’ amounts to 6 per cent of GDP even though none of this work exists. It is simply payment of rents from the home owners to themselves as a measure of capital gains. Argument made is that there would be a distortion in international and inter-temporal comparisons of production and consumption if housing services were ignored in the GDP accounts. The example would be Switzerland (high rent rate) having a higher GDP than the US (high ownership rate) due to the difference in these rates. Rent seeking is also an issue - increasing the rent increases the value produced by real estate sector but what if the quality of rental services does not see a corresponding improvement? New York and London tenants as example know too well the impact of rising real estate markets but no change in quality for them as tenants. We will consider this topic further in Chapter 3 through our discussion of the thermodynamic basis of the economy.\nThere is a mythical substructure to our “social sciences” - what appear as unassailable axioms, the stable points around which our self-knowledge is organized, are scattering like mice. Myth in itself is not a problem. Just as all societies have their science, all societies have their myths. Myth is the way in which human societies give structure and meaning to experience. But the larger mythic structures of history we’ve been deploying for the last several centuries simply don’t work any more; they are impossible to reconcile with the evidence now before our eyes… Max Planck once remarked that new scientific truths don’t replace old ones by convincing established scientists that they were wrong; they do so because proponents of the older theory eventually die, and generations that follow find the new truths and theories to be familiar, obvious even.\nWestern Critiques of Western Research As discussed in the previous chapter, the Western cultural archive con tained within it several traditions of knowledge and rules of practice for engaging in debates over knowledge. These rules enabled systems or methods of self-critique. The notion of research as an objective, value fr ee and scientific process for observing and making sense of human realities is taken for granted by many social scientists. Philosophers of science refer to this attitude as ‘positivism’. Differences in approach to research, however, have been the subject of continuous debate, as those engaged in attempts to understand human society grapple with the problematic nature of social science inquiry. Within the social sciences there have been a number of disputes over method, meanings and what constitutes ‘good’ research. Method is important because it is regarded as the way in which knowledge is acquired or discovered and as a way in which we can ‘know’ what is real. Each academic discipline is attached not just to a set of ideas about knowledge, but also to methodologies. Disputes over method occur both within disciplines and across disciplines. This is not surprising, considering that all academic disciplines, as defined by the West, are derived from shared philo sophical foundations. Some disputes, however, have ‘raged’ within the scientific world and have contributed to major schisms in theoretical positions.2 At one level, this debate has been concerned primarily with issues related to methodolo and method. These issues focus u on the appropriateness of research design and analysis. Definitions of validity · · m� t ro construct and perfect scientific instruments or o servrng an exp a1n111g human behaviour and the human condition. At a broader level, however, the debate has been concerned with the wider aims and role of research. Social science fields of inquiry are dependent on the way society is viewed, and the body of knowledge which legitimates that viewpoint. The dispute at this level is over the validity of scientific methods within the positivist paradigm, and whether this is an appropriate paradigm for understanding human society. - Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples is a book by New Zealand academic Linda Tuhiwai Smith.\nA distinction must be made between laws of nature and laws of social behaviour. First, we can note that laws of nature are immutable but constantly evolving. Gravity is a law of nature defined by mathematical terms developed by Newton but expanded upon and refined by Einstein. Laws of social behaviour, such as those defined by economics, are by their nature constructs of a particular social (i.e., moral) system. For illustration, let us consider the consumption of goods central to microeconomic analysis. The classical economic calculus says that a good has a monetary price, which an individual considers subject to a constraint imposed by their income. Their goal is to maximize the utility of goods consumption subject to this income constraint. We will return to this fundamental example many times through this book. However, for the moment let us begin by examining the assumptions of this statement. First, do all goods have a monetary price? Certainly not! I can take a tree branch and transform it into a walking staff, fence post, or any number of other useful goods without any expenditure of money. Until the last 300 years, most households produced the majority of their own goods and services outside the economic market. I recall submitting a grant proposal on consumption subject to natural resource constraints. The response from reviewers was that individuals do not consumer resources when making consumption decisions, as though this behaviour were an immutable feature of human decision-making and not a feature of the prevailing social system being prefaced on monetary markets. As noted above, for most of human history resource considerations were the prevailing constraint on consumption as goods could not be shipped over long distances at low cost. Within the blip of human existence on earth, the centring of income constrained consumption is a sub-blip of inperceivable duration. Not a fundamental law of nature - just a social construct that may be altered through moral training. As stated by Graeber and Wengrow, “in developing the scientific means to know our own past, we have exposed the mythical substructure of our ‘social science’ - what once appeared unassailable axioms, the stable points around which self-knowledge is organized, are scattering like mice”. What then is the purpose of new knowledge (or re-discover old knowledge), if not to create new and (or re-create) different forms of social reality?\nMyth in itself is not the problem here. It shouldn’t be mistaken for bad or infantile science. Just as all societies have their science, all societies have their myth. Myth is the way in which human societies give structure and meaning to experience. But the larger mythic structures of history we’ve been deploying for the last several centuries simply don’t work any more; they are impossible to reconcile with the evidence now before our eyes, the structures and meanings they encourage are tawdry, shop-worn, and politically disastrous… Max Planck once remarked that new scientific truths don’t replace old ones by convincing established scientist that they were wrong they do so because proponents of the older theory eventually die, and generations that follow find the new truths and theories to be familiar, obvious even.” Notion of research as objective, value free and scientific process for observing and making sense of human realities is taken for granted by many social scientists. Philosophers refer to this attitude as “positivism”. Differences in approach to research, however, have been the subject of continuous debate, as those engaged in attempts to understand human society grapple with the problematic nature of social science inquiry. Number of disputes over methods within social science. Method important because regarded as way in which knowledge is acquired or discovered and as way we “know” what is real. At one level concerned with methodology and methods around appropriate research design and analysis. At broader level, debate concerns wider aims and role of research. - from Dawn of Everything"

    "text": "Economics operates legitimately and usefully within a “given” framework which lies altogether outside the economic calculus. We might say that economics does not stand on its own feet, or that it is a “derived” body of thought - derived from meta-economics… there are boundaries to the applicability of the economic calculus, he is likely to fall into a similar kind of error as that of certain medieval theologians who tried to settle questions of physics by means of biblical quotations.” Edward Copleston pointed to the danger of economics usurping the rest of science 200?? years ago. Economics has the tendency due to its relevance to certain strong drivers of human nature - envy and greed. Meta-economics is then the study of two parts: man and his environment (economics being study of man in his environment). Economics must derive its aims and objectives from the study of man and a large part of its methodology from the study of nature!! Important distinction between primary and secondary goods because secondary goods presuppose the existence of primary goods. An expansion of man’s ability to generate secondary goods is of no good unless it is prefaced by an increased ability to extract primary goods from the earth. “We produce in order to be able to afford certain amenities and comforts as ‘consumers’. If, however, somebody demanded these same amenities and comforts while he was engaged in ‘production’, he would be told that this would be uneconomic, that it would be inefficient, and that society could not afford such inefficiency. In other words, everything depends on whether it is done by man-as-producer or by man-as-consumer. If man-as- producer travels first-class or uses a luxurious car, this is called a waste of money: but if the same man in his other incarnation of man-as-consumer does the same, this is called a sign of a high standard of life. Nowhere is this dichotomy more noticeable than in connection with the use of the land. The farmer is considered simply as a producer who must cut his costs and raise his efficiency by every possible device, even if he thereby destroys - for man-as-consumer - the health of the soil and beauty of the landscape, and even if the end effect is the depopulation of the land and the overcrowding of cities. There are large-scale farmers, horticulturists, food manufacturers and fruit growers today who would never think of consuming any of their own products. ‘luckily, they say, ’we have enough money to be able to afford to buy products which have been organically grown, without the use of poisons.’ When-they are asked why they themselves do not adhere to organic methods and avoid the use of poisonous substances, they reply that they could not afford to do so. What man-as-producer can afford is one thing; what man-as-consumer can afford is quite another thing. But since the two are the same man, the question of what man - or society - can really afford gives rise to endless confusion…. The higher animals have an economic value because of their utility; but they have a meta-economic value in themselves. If I have a car, a man-made thing, I might quite legitimately argue that the best way to use it is never to bother about maintenance and simply run it to ruin. I may indeed have calculated that this is the most economical method of use. If the calculation is correct, nobody can criticise me for acting accordingly, for there is nothing sacred about a man-made thing like a car. But if I have an animal - be it only a calf or a hen - a living, sensitive creature, am I allowed to treat it as nothing but a utility?”"

This algorithm clusters observations (in our case users) in order to maximize the cross-cluster variation in the input features. Our features are defined by the variables described above. We use siloutte analysis to find the optimal number of clusters. The silhouette value is a measure of how similar an observation is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette ranges from −1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. Our results suggest the that four clusters are ideal here.\n\n\nFor n_clusters = 2 The average silhouette_score is : 0.4653705024493721\nFor n_clusters = 3 The average silhouette_score is : 0.48854051475775756\nFor n_clusters = 4 The average silhouette_score is : 0.5065985416901237\nFor n_clusters = 5 The average silhouette_score is : 0.4497914115339878\nFor n_clusters = 6 The average silhouette_score is : 0.4615478858524191",

    "text": "The human economy exists within broader social and ecological environments. While neoclassical environmental economics assumes weak sustainabilty through the assumption that natural capital is fully substitutible by human and manufactured capital, we advance the strong sustainability definition that natural capital is a finite resource and is only partially substitutable. Drawing on engineering and natural scientific knowledge, we advance theory, methods, and empirical study of household behaviour through an ecological economics lens. Our theoretical work explores non-capitalist political economy, environmental ethics, climate science, and thermodynamics. Empirical applications use a combination of choice econometrics and network science to understand the constraints and interdepencies of human-ecological systems."

If a new parking policy results in an increase of out-of-pocket auto costs from $5 to $6, what will be the change in demand?\nIn addition to part (a), if transit facility improvements lead to a reduction in transit time from 1 hour to 45 minutes, what would be the new demand for automobile travel between the two cities?\n\nProblem 2.

The first was a linear regression model given by: \\[y=0.2+0.5x_1+1.1z_1  \\text{, }R^2=0.78\\]\nwhere y is household peak period trips, \\(x_1\\) is the number of workers in the household, and \\(z_1\\) is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if household income is over 70,000 and 0otherwise. The second was cross-classification analysis model based on two income strata (high and low income) and two levels of family income (1 or fewer and 2 or more workers per households). The estimated trip rates are:\nTable 2.2.

Explain your answer.\nProblem 3. There is a demand of 600 trips from zone A to zone B. Two modes are available for travelling from zone A to zone B, transit and single occupant automobile. A binary logit model has been developed that predicts mode choice between those zones with the following utility functions:\n\\[V(transit)=-0.20-0.15IVTT(transit)-0.30TWALK(transit)\n              - 0.40 TWAIT(transit) - 0.20 COST(transit)\\]\n\\[V(auto)=-0.25 IVTT(auto)\\]\nwhere \\(IVTT\\), \\(TWALK\\), and \\(TWAIT\\) are in-vehicle travel time, walk time and wait time, measured in minutes and \\(COST\\) is in dollars.\nTable 3.1.

Stations are at the centroids of zones A and B, which are 400m x 600m rectangular zones. Zones have randomly distributed origins-destinations and a Manhattan grid. Walking speed is 1.25m/s.\nAuto in vehicle travel time depends on a BPR formula as follows:\n\\[IVTT(auto) = (60L/S)*(1 + (v/c)^4)\\] Road length (L) = 10 km Free flow speed (S) = 65 km/hr Road capacity (c) = 550 veh/hr\nAssume that only vehicles travelling from A to B use the highway.\n\nDetermine the in-vehicle travel time by transit. (6 marks)\nDetermine the expected walk and wait time for transit. (4 marks)\nDetermine the mode shares that would be predicted by the model assuming free flow roadway travel times. (5 marks)\nDetermine the number of vehicles (to the nearest 50) on the road that would be predicted by the model assuming congested roadway travel times (Hint, you can use trial and error).

Show all calculations and equations. Do not use Excel or other software packages.\nProblem 1. Consider the simple network in the below figure where there are 100 vehicles per hour travelling from A to X and 500 from B to X. The travel time versus flow relationships (volume-delay functions) are depicted in the figure in minutes and the flow v in vehicles per hour.\na. Express the objective function of the mathematical program corresponding to Wardrop’s user equilibrium in terms of the flows and travel time-flow relationships in the figure. Hint: refer to the Traffic Assignment lecture slides.\nb. Calculate the equilibrium flows on each link and the travel time for each group of travelers. Calculate the value of the objective function above under equilibrium conditions – i.e., the total expenditure in travel time on the network in veh-hr. You should start with an incremental assignment. You can assume the following loading: 50% A-&gt;X, 50% B-&gt;X, 50% B-&gt;X, 50% A-&gt;X. You should then use an all-or-nothing assignment as your second volume in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Perform only one FW iteration. You can use the same FW approximation as in the class example – i.e., evaluate \\(\\lambda\\) = 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Local traffic engineers have decided to install speed restrictions on link C-&gt;D so that the new travel time versus flow function is: t=5.2+0.002v\nThe total expenditure in travel time (veh-hr) in the system is less than in (b) under these conditions. Why would this be the case? The following two tables show the final Frank-Wolfe flow results for the relationships in part (b) and (c), respectively.

    "text": "Can I use a local install of Python and Jupyter notebooks instead of using the VS codespace?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of Python for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the Python packages we’re using in the course. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the VS codespace we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install Python 3.9\nDownload and install an IDE, such as Anaconda, Visual Studio Code, etc.\nInstall any necessary packages with conda install or pip install depending on your setup\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here.",

    "text": "Report 3: Mode Choice\n\nDevelop a multinomial logit (MNL) mode choice model for home-based non-work trips. Some experimentation will likely be required to find the “best” model that can be obtained given the available data and the model type chosen. Present and discuss the results of your analysis in terms of the statistical significance of the parameter estimates, the goodness-of-fit of the model, and the rationale for the variables selected for inclusion in the model. Your discussion should also include consideration of elasticity estimates.\nSimilarly develop an MNL mode choice model for home-based work trips. Compare your results with those obtained for the home-based non-work trip model with respect to explanatory variables used, parameter statistical significance, and model goodness-of-fit. Discuss likely reasons for these differences (if any). Your discussion should also include consideration of elasticity estimates.",

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final models; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your study area from statistical analysis and literature review. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written reports/Jupyter notebooks.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 15 pages.\nPoints for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written reports/Jupyter notebooks. The Jupyter notebooks should be neatly organized and interpretable to a knowledgeable reader.",

Also, within the hourglass there is neither creation nor destruction of sand; the amount in the hourglass is constant. This is the analogy of the First Law of Thermodynamics - conservation of matter and energy. There is a continual running down of sand in the top chamber and an accumulation of sand in the bottom chamber (i.e., earth). We can assume that the amount of solar energy in the top chamber is limitless but the flow rate is fixed from our perspective on earth.\nConsider the second hourglass representing earth. Sand in the top chamber has potential energy; it is low entropy, or available energy and matter. This is the analogy to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. We can consider the sand in the top chamber as the stock of low-entropy fossil fuels, which flows into the bottom chamber as high-entropy water matter. However, unlike the left-hand hourglass, we have some control over the flow. This is demand! The solar source of low entropy energy is stock-abundant but flow-limited. The terrestrial source is stock-limited but flow-abundant.\nHow might the hourglass analogy apply to your infrastructure system of interest - e.g., transportation, water, electricity? Think about the supply and demand relationships for the system.",

The article begins:\n“Each month many women experience an ovulatory cycle that regulates fertility. Whereas research finds that this cycle influences women’s mating preferences, we propose that it might also change women’s political and religious views. Building on theory suggesting that political and religious orientation are linked to reproductive goals, we tested how fertility influenced women’s politics, religiosity, and voting in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. In two studies with large and diverse samples, ovulation had drastically different effects on single versus married women. Ovulation led single women to become more liberal, less religious, and more likely to vote for Barack Obama. In contrast, ovulation led married women to become more conservative, more religious, and more likely to vote for Mitt Romney. In addition, ovulatory-induced changes in political orientation mediated women’s voting behavior. Overall, the ovulatory cycle not only influences women’s politics, but appears to do so differently for single versus married women.”",

As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask me why. If you’re not sure about the assignments or project, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nContribute to the group assignments.\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions.

    "text": "Course Policies\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nAcademic honesty policy\nAcademic integrity is of the utmost importance at Nebraska. Be sure you understand expectations of you and your academic work. For more information, please visit https://www.ucalgary.ca/legal-services/university-policies-procedures/student-academic-misconduct-policy. If you are unsure what counts as academic dishonesty in this course, please visit me to. The first instance of academic dishonesty will result in a score of zero for the assignment. The second incidence of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade for the course.\n\n\nAccommodations for students with disabilities policy\nIt is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming experience for all students.  Reasonable accommodations are provided for students who are registered with Student Accessibility Services make their requests sufficiently in advance. For more information, contact Student Accessibility Services\n\n\nResource for students seeking mental health help\nThe University offers a variety of options to students to aid them in dealing with stress and adversity.  There is a multidisciplinary team of experts that works collaboratively with Calgary students to help them explore their feelings and thoughts and learn helpful ways to improve their mental, psychological and emotional well-being when issues arise. More details are available from Mental Health Services.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website (https://unl-hawkins-lab.github.io/Hawkinslab/teaching/ENCI707/ENCI707.html).\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and D2L - make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nI am here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “ENCI 707” in the subject line. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to ENCI 707 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow, ChatGPT) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure I can provide feedback within a timely manner. I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nAssignments may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for assignments.\nThe late work policy holds for both group assignments and individual project deliverables.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Jason Hawkins before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted by D2L within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project deadline.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day. If you miss a lecture, make sure to communicate with your project team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nCell phone use and professional behaviour\nWhen you come to class, your cell phone must be turned off or silenced and put away where it is not a distraction to you or anyone else. The instructor’s expectations for classroom behaviour are based on the norms of the engineering profession. Questions and discussion related to class material are welcome and encouraged but respect for the instructor and fellow classmates is required at all times.",

While it is a draft, I expect high quality and thorough submissions at this stage. I will provide detailed feedback and schedule a time for a review discussion.\nYou will submit the PDF of your plan on D2L.\nThere is a 15-page limit for the plan document (excluding references). The draft plan will be marked out of 60, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n60 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n6 pts\n\n\nData\n10 pts\n\n\nResearch questions/hypotheses\n10 pts\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\n24 pts\n\n\nNext Steps\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation and objectives.\n\nGrading criteria\n\nThe research motivation and objectives are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for any external research.\nThe research objectives have a logical structure centered on the research motivation. Objectives should be easily understood and limited to the key objectives - a suggested number of objectives is 3-5.\n\n\n\n\nResearch questions/hypotheses\nThis section provides an elaboration of the research objectives, questions, and hypotheses. It should provide a clear connection to the data and analysis plan discussed in the subsequent sections. A research question may relate to the feasibility of a new econometric method; the effectiveness of a policy, incentive, or regulation; or the behavioural response of individuals, firms, or other entities to a change in an engineering system (e.g., travel time, cost of water, etc.).\n\nGrading criteria\n\nThe research questions/hypotheses are clearly stated and flow logically from the motivations and objectives defined in the previous section.\nThe research questions/hypotheses demonstrate extensive thought about the process under study and its mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nData\nThis section should detail the datasets used to accomplish the research objectives and answer the associated research questions/hypotheses. The data section should provide details on data formats and sources. You should discuss the reliability of each data source in terms of its sample size relative to the population, measurement accuracy, and other details discussed in lecture. You should also discuss the limitations of each dataset in terms of its spatial and temporal resolution, completeness, and other details discussed in lecture. This section should also include a discussion of data processing steps. It may include basic summary statistics and charts, depending upon the availability of data (e.g., a study proposing a new survey instrument would not require such details) and the complexity of the data processing task.\n\nGrading criteria\n\nThe data are sufficient to address the research questions included in the research plan.\nSufficient detail is provided for the reader to understand the merits and limitations of the proposed datasets.\nThe research questions are firmly situated in the literature in terms of previous findings and how your work contributes to the relevant literature.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis plan\nThis section is the core of the plan. You should demonstrate how you will integrate data and methods to accomplish your researh objectives. While it is not required that you perform the analysis, it should be clear from the plan how you would execute the analysis. You should include a discussion of the proposed methods, as well as practical details. Methods might include econometric models, statistical tests, algorithms, or other analytics. Practical details are the specific software packages you propose to use in the work. If the research includes a survey, its details must be provided here including survey questions, sample frame, recruitment methods, and other details necessary to assess the ability of the survey instrument to answer the research question(s). An econometric methods plan must include initial derivations. A causal inference plan must include a plausible identification strategy that is specific to the research question.\n\nGrading criteria\n\nSufficient detail is provided for the reader to execute the research plan with minimal assumptions.\nIf an ecometric methods plan, there is sufficient sophistication in the proposed work based on the background of the student. If a survey plan, a detailed survey instrument is included in the document. If the survey includes a stated choice experiment, the attributes and their levels are supported by literature sources. If a causal inference plan, the identification strategy is supported by the literature and available data. If a policy analysis plan,…\n\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\n\nThe report is neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels.\nNumerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted.\nAll citations and links are properly formatted.\nThe main body of the written report (not including the references) is no longer than 15 pages.\n\n\n\n\nGrading summary\nGrading of the project will take into account the following:\n\nContent - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?\nCorrectness - Are statistical procedures explained correctly?\nWriting and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?\nCreativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning of the project?\n\nA general breakdown of scoring is as follows:\n\n90%-100%: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all econometric and policy analysis concepts, can translate their learning into a cogent plan, can identify weaknesses in the plan, and can clearly communicate the plan to others.\n80%-89%: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate plan, identifies some weaknesses of their plan, and communicates most plan elements clearly to others.\n70%-79%: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting concepts together in a cogent plan, and communication of plans is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent plan. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60%: Student is not making a sufficient effort.",

Often the case that variance is higher in larger (or higher valued) than smaller (or smaller valued) units.\nExample: A study by the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O) Railroad Company to determine how much revenue they should get from interline freight shipments, since the total freight from a shipment that traveled along several railroads was divided among the different railroads. The C&O took a stratified sample of waybills - the documents that detailed the goods, route, and charge for the shipments. The waybills were stratified by the total freight charges. All waybills with charges over $40 were sampled, whereas only 1% of those with charges less than $5 were sampled. There was little variation in the amount owed to C&O among the smallest total freight charges, whereas the variability in the stratum with charges of over $40 was much higher."
