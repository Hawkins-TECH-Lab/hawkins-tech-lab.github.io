 @article{Becker_1965, title={A Theory of the Allocation of Time}, volume={75}, ISSN={00130133}, DOI={10.2307/2228949}, abstractNote={The article attempts to develop a general theory of the allocation of time in non-work activities. It sets out a basic theoretical analysis of choice that includes the cost of time on the same footing as the cost of market goods and treats various empirical implications of the theory. These include a new approach to changes in hours of work and leisure, the full integration of so-called productive consumption into economic analysis, a new analysis of the effect of income on the quantity and quality of commodities consumed, some suggestions on the measurement of productivity, an economic analysis of queues and a few others as well. The integration of production and consumption is at odds with the tendency for economists to separate them sharply, production occurring in firms and consumption in households. It should be pointed out, however, that in recent years economists increasingly recognize that a household is truly a small factory. It combines capital goods, raw materials and labor to clean, feed, procreate and otherwise produce useful commodities.}, note={arXiv: 1011.1669v3

Over the years there have been a number of attempts to modify neoclassical consumer theory to deal with problems of this nature, but none of these works achieved the level of sophistication of the traditional approach, where- by testable properties of demand functions are deduced. In part, this has been intentional. These studies were more concerned with specific problems such as the decision to work more or fewer hours [19], the effect of foregone earnings upon consumer choice [1] and the valuation of travel time [10, 17], rather than with the general properties of demand functions. More im- portantly, however, the restrictions on demand functions derived from neo- classical theory cannot be derived from existing theories of the time dimen- sion in consumer choice. This is due not to any property intrinsic to the time dimension but to the fact that these theories are improperly specified. The essential features of the model presented in this paper are: (1) utility is a function not only of commodities but also of the time allocated to them; (2) the individual’s decision is subject to two resource constraints, a money constraint and a time constraint; and (3) the decision to consume a specified amount of any commodity requires that some minimum amount of time be allocated to it, but the individual may spend more time in that activity if he so desires. Under these specifications, all the implications of neoclassical theory are preserved and many additional results, applicable to situations involving a time dimension, are generated.

However, a comprehensive conceptual structure to understand the technological relations between goods consumption and the assignment of time to activities is still lacking. In this paper the problem is reviewed and all possible relations between goods and time are re-formulated. Two general functions are defined and proposed to account for all these relations, forming a new taxonomy for the technical constraints. The resulting consumer behaviour model is used to obtain general expressions for both the value of saving time in constrained activities like travel, and the value of leisure.}, note={Citation Key: Jara-Diaz2003}, number={3}, journal={Transportation}, author={Jara-Díaz, Sergio R.}, year={2003}, pages={245–260} }

Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries; Includes bibliographical references (pages 245-270) and index; Series editors’ preface -- Preface -- Reflections on the commons -- An institutional approach to the study of self-organization and self-governance in CPR situations -- Analyzing long-enduring, self-organized, and self-governed CPRs -- Analyzing institutional change -- Analyzing institutional failures and fragilities -- A framework for analysis of self-organizing and self-governing CPRs -- Notes -- References -- Index; Nobel Prize, 2009; Self-Renewing 2017}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Ostrom, Elinor}, year={1990}, language={eng} }

Under very weak assumptions there will always exist a unique Nash equilibrium in our model. A small redistribution of wealth among the contributing consumers will not change the equilibrium amount of the public good. However, larger redistributions of wealth will change the set of contributors and thereby change the equilibrium provision of the public good. We are able to characterize the properties and the comparative statics of the equilibrium in a quite complete way and to analyze the extent to which government provision of a public good “crowds out” private contributions.}, journal={Journal of Public Economics}, author={Bergstrom, Theodore and Blume, Lawrence and Varian, Hal}, year={1986}, pages={2549} }

The appropriate social response to declining mass transit quality can more easily be seen by recognizing it to be an example of what happens when demand declines for a commodity whose production involves increasing returns to scale. The purposes of this paper are to justify this assertion and to suggest the magnitude of mass transit scale economies and hence the lower bound for an optimal transit subsidy policy. Transportation differs from the typical commodity of price theory texts in that travelers and shippers play a producing, not just a consuming role. In using common carrier services, they must supply scarce inputs, their own time or that of the goods they ship, that are essential to the production process. In dealing with many transportation problems, it is both useful and sound analytically to separate these two roles. That is to say, transport costs can be analyzed as if user inputs are purchased in factor markets rather than supplied in kind. Transport demand can be dealt with as if the price of a trip equals whatever fare is charged plus the money value the traveler attaches to the time his trip requires.}, note={Citation Key: Mohring1972}, number={4}, journal={The American Economic Review}, author={Mohring, Herbert}, year={1972}, pages={591–604} }
