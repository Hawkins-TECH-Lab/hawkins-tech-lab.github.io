Whether you agree with his approach or its outcomes, there is no denying is ability to get things done. Robert A. Caro is among the great biographers of the 20th century.

This book is an excellent read for anyone looking for an alternative to the Western scientific narrative. I was particuarly taken by the dichotomy drawn by Kimerer between *origin stories* and their effect on our relationship to the environment. Braiding Sweetgrass is a beautiful weaving of personal narrative and ecological philosophy.|

Schumacher was a 20th century economist who held various roles in industry. I purchased the book on the recommendation of its discussion of small-scale economics and critique of growth-oriented economics. I was pleasantly surprised by the discussion of development economics and forecasting. Scumacher's views on these topics are equally enlightening and challenging of conventional discourse. I provide a deeper discussion in several posts from May and June 2024.|
