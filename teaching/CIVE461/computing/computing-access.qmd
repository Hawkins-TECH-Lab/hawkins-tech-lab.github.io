To access computing resources for CIVE 461/861:

1.  Create a Google account.

2. Install Google Colaboratory as an additional app (if not already available). It can be downloaded by clicking the **New** button, **More**, **Connect more apps**, and searching for **Colaboratory**.

3. (a)  Download the **CIVE461.zip** file from the CIVE461 Canvas page under the **Assignments** module.

5. If you have any issues, please consult a friend before contacting the instructor or GTA.
