## Road Vs. Street

**Question**: What is the difference between these terms?

**Road** is a high speed connection between two places.

**Street** is a platform for building community wealth.

**Stroad** is a street with road design features.

## Road - But is it in the right place?

## Transportation as *Derived* Demand {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Transport demand is *derived* meaning it is not an end in itself – except sight-seeing
-   **Question**: What do you think this means?
-   People travel to satisfy a need at spatially dispersed locations (work, leisure, health) by undertaking an **activity**
-   Good transport **broadens opportunities** to satisfy these needs – heavily congested or poorly connected system restricts options and limits economic and social development
-   Transport demand is **highly qualitative** and **differentiated**
    -   By time of day, day of week, journey purpose, type of cargo, importance of speed and frequency
:::

## Transportation Supply {.smaller}

-   Transportation supply a **service** - cannot stockpile it to use at different time of high demand
    -   Service must be consumed when and where produced, otherwise benefit is lost
-   Supply includes **fixed assets** (infrastructure) & **mobile assets** (vehicles) - in combination with rules of operation, make possible movement of goods & people
-   Often infrastructure & vehicles not owned/operated by same group
    -   Generates complex interactions b/w government (central & local), construction firms, developers, transport operators, travelers & shippers, & local residents

## Transportation Equilibrium {.smaller}

-   **Short-term equilibrium**: fixed activity system gives equilibrium points between supply and demand
-   **Long-term equilibrium**: Levels of service changes over space and time - expect long-term equilibrium (or dynamic evolution)
-   Plan for future that maximizes social welfare for all
    -   **Question**: What is social welfare to you?

## Transport Costs & Subsidies (Left-Of-Center View)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 0.5em;"}
-   In addition to gas tax (federal tax **18 cents per gallon** since 1980s!):
    -   **\$597 per U.S. household per year** in general tax revenue dedicated to road construction & repair
    -   **\$199 to \$675 per household per year** in additional tax subsidies for driving - e.g., sales tax exemption for gasoline purchases in many states & federal income tax exclusion for commuter parking benefits
    -   **\$216 per household per year** in government expenditures made necessary by vehicle crashes, plus additional, uncompensated damages to victims and property
    -   **\$93 to \$360 per household per year** in costs related to air pollution-induced health damage

-   Does not include **parking subsidy**
-   Does not include **crash costs**
-   Transit subsidy per mile estimated at 76% by APTA – **50% equity-justified**
-   Note farebox recovery ratios (user cost / total cost) can vary:
    -   Hong Kong MTR = 172%
    -   Amsterdam = 88%
    -   Toronto TTC = 66%
    -   New York MTA = 24%
    -   Chicago CTA = 16%

## Development Trap

-   Private vehicle owners choose their **work** & **home** location without considering transit availability
-   **Urban sprawl** results: low density development more difficult to service by efficient transit
-   Further **congestion** & higher proportion of time spent in slow moving vehicles

## Emerging Economy Cities

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Population growth in many emerging economy cities will maintains demand for public transit
-   **Question**: What about private vehicle ownership?

# Course Overview

## Role Of Theory & Data {.smaller}

-   Both **theory** & **data** required to understand complex interations in transportation system
-   Sometimes possible to derive same function form from different theoretical foundations
    -   **Gravity model** from classical mechanics
    -   **Entropy maximization** from statistical mechanics
    -   **Maximum utility** from economics
-   If goal is **flow measure** on road links - any of above theories work
-   If goal is **welfare evaluation** - only theory based on human behavior is helpful

## Primer On Logic

-   Two classical approaches to theory development
    -   **Deductive** builds a theoretical model & tests its prediction against observation (common in pure & social sciences)
    -   **Inductive** collects data & searches for general laws (common in engineering & computer science)

## Primer On Logic {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Deductive reasoning** begins from a **premise** that is **proven** through observation
    -   Conclusions reliable provided premises are true
    -   Argument "All bald men are grandfathers. Harold is bald. Therefore, Harold is a grandfather" logically valid but untrue if original premise is false
-   **Inductive reasoning** extracts a **likely** (but not certain) **premise** from **specific & limited observations**
    -   You pull three coins from a bag & each coin is a penny
    -   Inductive reasoning might suggest all coins in bag are pennies
    -   Even if initial observations are correct, inductive reasoning does not guarantee conclusion is true
:::

## Role Of Data & Theory

-   Data & aggregation
    -   How many population strata do we need to understand problem?
    -   How much detail do we need to measure certain variables to replicate phenonema?
    -   **Space** is critical in transport: what level of detail to code trip **origins** & **destinations** to model trip-making behavior?

## Models & Their Roles {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   We will devote large portion of class towards developing models
-   **Model** is simply representation of part of real-world system of interest
-   Model may be **physical** or **abstract**
    -   **Physical models** used in architecture & fluid mechanics
    -   **Abstract models** are mental models used in daily interactions with world - formal & abstract (typically analytical) representations of theory about system of interest/how it works
    -   **Mental models** important & enhance discussion, training, & experience but difficult to communicate

:::
:::::

## Models & Their Roles {.smaller}

-   We will focus on a class of abstract models: mathematical models that replicate system behavior via mathematical equations based on theory
-   Models provide common ground for discussing policy and outcomes with a level of objectivity
-   Engineers/planners can learn much about a system from the formulation, calibration, and experimentation with a model (not even use)
-   Mathematical models can help hone mental models and mean more intelligent management of transport system
-   Models (mental) are inevitable but formal models are desirable

## Models & Their Roles {.smaller}

-   Computers can make error-free calculations BUT humans are error- and bias-prone ![](../images/lecture1/model_computer_mental.png){.absolute bottom="100" right="0" width="50%"} ![](../images/lecture1/ice_cream_murders_nyc.png){.absolute bottom="250" left="0"}

## Transportation Planning (and CIVE461) Focus Shift {.smaller}

-   Field is shifting towards methods that are more human-centered and realistic and away from the mechanistic methods adopted from physics analogy

-   Focus on time, geographic space, social space, and institutional context

-   We ignored complexity, non-linearity, and uncertainty in past approaches

-   Traditional viewpoint of transport experts and policy makers is that transportation systems exist to provide for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in an environmentally responsible manner

## Transportation Planning (and CIVE461) Focus Shift {.smaller}

-   Decisions historically reserved for technical experts with very little (if any) public input
-   In the 1970s, mainly because of the oil crisis, attention was also paid to managing the transportation system as a system of interconnected components
-   Realizing increased capacity is not sufficient to satisfy increasing demand for services, policy analysts and policy makers shifted their attention to a more efficient management of facilities (e.g., utilize the capacity of a highway by spreading its use over the day)
-   New construction reserved for strategic interventions such as the provision of connectivity among existing roadways
-   Shift of policies away from expanding capacity to managing demand and the introduction of a systems approach to transportation has been advocated since the late 1960s – yet not adopted by many engineering undergraduate programs…

## Transportation Planning (and CIVE461) Focus Shift {.smaller}

-   More recent perspective: integrated and systematic view
-   Economic and social development role
-   Private automobile can be examined in a more critical way and contrasted with many other mobility options that may yield the same benefits but at lower social costs
-   At the core is provision of access to activities and services for all (equity principle)
-   Unfortunately, priority in transport policies has been given to higher mobility (ability to move) instead of higher accessibility (ability to reach locations and opportunities)
-   Since mobility is “purchased,” specific groups of the urban or rural population do not have adequate access to basic services
-   Yet, they are burdened with the costs (e.g., health, taxation) of mobility
-   I have re-focused CIVE461 to provide you with the tools and knowledge to compete in the current transportation workforce

## Workforce Trends {.smaller}

-   Multi-modal transportation planning
-   Complete Streets – Nebraska DOT focused on it for small communities
-   Larger datasets = Excel -\> R & Python
-   Non-infrastructure solutions – ridesharing, autonomous vehicles, pricing, and land use reform
