# Statistics Fundamentals

## **What is Statistics?**
> Study of methods and techniques to **summarize** & **interpret** data


## **Descriptive Statistics**
::: incremental
  -   Relative standing
  -   Central tendency
  -   Variability
  -   Association
:::

## **Measures of Relative Standing** {.smaller}
- **Quartiles** are percentage points that separate data into quarters
  - E.g., 25th percentile means 25% of data lie below this value (often referred to as *first quartile*)
- **Interquartile range** is difference between first quartile (25th percentile) and third quartile (75th percentile)
- 50th percentile often referred to as *median*

## **Measures of Central Tendency** {.smaller}
- **Median** often more useful than arithmetic **mean** (average) because mean **biased** by outliers
- Interquartile range similarly resident to outliers relative to **range**, which include minimum & maximum values

## **Measures of Variability** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- **Variance** & **standard deviation** more useful than **range** because use information from all observations
- Sample variance given by
$$ s^2 = \frac{\sum_i(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
- **Why n-1?** By using sample mean, lose one degree of freedom - i.e., $n-1$ independent observations
- For small samples, tendency to underestimate standard deviation
  - $n-1$ approaches n as sample size grows
:::

## **Measures of Association** {.smaller}
- **Covariance** & **correlation** are measures of association between two variables
- Correlation a normalization of covariance to lie within interval [-1, 1]
- **Note**: possible for two variables with zero correlation to be nonlinearly related

## **Measures of Association** {.smaller}
$$COV_p(X,Y) = \frac{\sum_i (x_i-\mu_X)(y_i-\mu_Y)}{N}$$
$$COV_s(X,Y) = \frac{\sum_i (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{n-1}$$
Pearson product-moment correlation parameter
$$\rho = \frac{COV_p(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$$
$$r = \frac{COV_s(X,Y)}{s_X s_Y}$$

## **Properties of Estimators** {.smaller}

. . .

**Unbiasedness** means the expected value (mean) of estimator equals the associated population value

![](../images/lecture2/unbiased.png){fig-align="center"}

. . .

**Efficiency** is a relative measure of variance. An estimator with a smaller variance is said to be more *efficient*

![](../images/lecture2/efficiency.png){fig-align="center"}


## **Properties of Estimators** {.smaller}
. . .

**Consistency** exists if the probability of being close to the true parameter value increases with increasing sample size

![](../images/lecture2/consistency.png){fig-align="center"}

## **Confidence Intervals**
::: incremental
- Interval estimates are based on *frequentist statistical theory*
- They say nothing about the location of the *true* parameter value
- They are a measure of how **likely** it is for **samples** taken from the **same population** to have their parameter values lie in that interval
- E.g., a 95% confidence interval of [1.15,2.34] means that 95 out of 100 samples will have the parameter value of interest in the range 1.15 to 2.34
:::

## **Hypothesis Testing** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- Used to measure whether a difference in parameter values is likely to have arisen **by chance** or whether **some other factor** is responsible for the difference
- Statistical distributions used in hypothesis testing to estimate probabilities of observing the sample data, given an assumption about what *should have* occurred
- If observed results are extremely unlikely to have occurred by chance given assumed conditions, then assumed conditions are considered **unlikely**
- P(data│true null hypothesis) = Probability of observing the sample data conditional upon a true null hypothesis – **NOT** probability of null hypothesis being true
- Often test parameter value equal to zero
  - **Problem:** often expect an effect and more interested in **variation in effect**
:::
. . .

$$Z^* = \frac{(\bar{X_1}-\bar{X_2}-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$

## **Data Display Methods** {.smaller}
. . .

# Basic Regression 
## **Regression Model Uses** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- **Prediction** - Modeling existing observations or forecasting new data
  - Outcome variable(s) can be 
    - **Continuous** like vote share in an election or future product sales
    - **Discrete** like individual voting decisions or victory in a sporting event
- **Explore Association** - Summarizing how well one variable, or set of variables, predicts outcomes
  - E.g., identifying risk factors for a disease or attitudes that predict voting

## **Regression Model Uses** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- **Extrapolation** - Adjusting for known differences between sample and population of interest
  - E.g., sample data from self-selecting schools to make conclusions about all schools in state
- **Causal inference** - Estimating treatment effects
  - E.g., exposure to a pollutant and health outcomes
:::

## **Linear Regression** {.smaller}
Consider experiment where we have values of a certain variable $Y={Y_𝑖}$ that takes different values based on the values of another variable $X$. If the process is **not deterministic**, we will observe different $Y_i$ for the same $X_i$

Let’s call $f_i(Y|X)$ the **probability distribution** for $Y_i$ for a given $X_i$; this means we could have a different function $f_i$ for each $X$ 

![](../images/lecture2/linear_regression_1.png){fig-align="center"}

## **Linear Regression** {.smaller}
However, such a general case is **intractable**; to make it more manageable, certain hypotheses about population regularity assumed:
- Probability distribution $f_i(Y|X)$ has **same variance** $\sigma^2$ for all values of $X$
- Mean $\mu_i = E(Y_i)$ forms a straight line known as the **true regression line** & given by
$$𝐸(𝑌)=a+bX_i$$ 
where $a$ and $b$ define the line & are estimated from sample data
- Random variables $Y_i$ are statistically independent; i.e., a large value of $Y_1$ doesn’t necessarily make $Y_2$ large

![](../images/lecture2/linear_regression_2.png){fig-align="center"}

## **Linear Regression** {.smaller}
Model is often written as $Y_i = a + bX_i + e_i$ where $e_i$ measures error/disturbance in data and includes both **measurement** & **specification** error

## **Fundamental Graph of Linear Regression**
![](../images/lecture2/fundamental_graph.png){fig-align="center"}

## **Important Considerations for Linear Regression** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- Important to distinguish between errors $e_i$, which are **unknown** & associated with true regression line and differences $\epsilon_i$ between observed $Y_i$ & fitted $\hat{Y}$
- **Least squares estimation (LSE)** - most common line-fitting method, results from the minimization of $\sqrt{\epsilon_i}$
- A **change of variables** can help to understand properties of the linear regression model
$$x_i = X_i - \bar{X}$$
where $\bar{X}$ is the mean of $\mathbf{X}$
:::

## **Important Considerations for Linear Regression** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- Previous regression lines keep their slopes ($b$ and $\hat{b}$) but change their intercepts ($a$ and $\hat{a}$)
- Change is useful because new variable $x$ has property that $\sum_i x_i = 0$
- Under this transformation, LSE are given by $\hat{a} = \hat{Y}$ so fitted line goes through the center of gravity ($\bar{X}, \bar{Y}$) of the sample and
$$\hat{b} = \sum_i \frac{x_i Y_i}{x_i^2}$$
:::

## **Important Considerations for Linear Regression** {.smaller}
Estimator properties given by
\begin{array}

EE(\hat{a}) = a & Var(\bar{a}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n} \\
E(\hat{b}) = b & Var(\bar{b}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_i x_i^2} \\

\end{array}

## **Interesting Experimental Design Point from Previous** {.smaller}
- Considering $Var(\hat{a}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ & $Var(\hat{b}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_i x_i^2}$
  - Variance of both estimators **decreases** with sample size
  - Variance of $\hat{b}$ tends to grow with closer together $x_i$ & $\hat{b}$ becomes **unreliable estimator**
  - Increased data spread (sampling points from across expected range) tends to decrease $Var(\hat{b})$

## **Properties of Regression Estimators** {.smaller}
::: incremental
- If $E(e|\mathbf{X}) = 0$, LSE have some desirable properties
  - Estimators are **unbiased** (i.e., expected values are equal to true values for $a$ and $b$)
  - Estimators are **consistent** (i.e., approach the true values with increasing sample size)
  - Assumption easily violated if relevant variable omitted from model correlated with observed $\mathbf{X}$
  - E.g., trip generation 
    - Depends on household income and number of vehicles, which are **positively correlated** variables since household more likely to own a vehicle as income grows
    - If number of vehicles omitted, LSE of income will include both income and number of vehicles effects; therefore parameter value will be larger than true value
:::

## **Properties of Regression Estimators**
If prior conditions hold, LSE are not only **consistent** & **unbiased**, but also **best** (most efficient/smallest variance) among possible linear unbiased estimators (BLUE) – known as **Gauss-Markov theorem**

## **Hypothesis Testing** {.smaller}
Need to know distribution of 𝑏 ̂, which requires strong assumption that variables Y are distributed Normal
In case of LSE, is BLUE and also BUE (best unbiased estimators) among all linear and non-linear estimators
Strong assumption but as sample size grows it will begin to hold true no matter the true distribution due to Law of Large Numbers
Since 𝑏 ̂ are linear combinations of Y, it follows they are distributed N=(b, 𝜎^2/(∑_𝑖▒𝑥_𝑖^2 ))
Can use the normal standardization to obtain a test statistic distributed standard normal N(0, 1)
𝑧=(𝑏 ̂−𝑏)/(𝜎∕√(∑_𝑖▒𝑥_𝑖^2 ))
We don’t know 𝜎^2. We can use the residual variance s2

## **Hypothesis Testing** {.smaller}
Substitution of s for 𝜎 means the standardized 𝑏 ̂ is now distributed Student t with (n-2) degrees of freedom
𝑡=(𝑏 ̂−𝑏)/(𝑠/√(∑_𝑖▒𝑥_𝑖^2 ))
Denominator of above is usually called the standard error. A typical null hypothesis is that 𝑏=0
The standard error is given by
𝑠^2=(∑_𝑖▒(𝑌_𝑖−𝑌 ̂_𝑖 ) )/(𝑛−𝑘) 
Where k is the number of parameters in the model. If n >> k, the t-statistics approximates a z-statistic
