## Trip-End Models {.smaller}
- Trip end mode split (**choice**) models apply before trip distribution & split *trip ends* estimated in trip generation among ends (**destinations**)
- Basically **mode-specific trip generation models** (e.g., regression or cross-classification)
- Trip-end mode split is a function of socio-economic variables such as income & auto ownership
- **Cannot include modal level-of-service attributes** (travel time, cost, etc.) since do not yet have O-D flows
- Works better for **short-term** & when there is **no modal competition** & traffic congestion – small urban & rural areas where transit is a *social service*

## Trip End Model Example

## Trip Interchange Model {.smaller}
- Trip interchange mode split (**choice**) models apply after trip distribution & split *trip interchanges* estimated in trip distribution
- Since O-D flows are known, **can compute travel times, costs, etc.** for competing modes
- Trip interchange models generally applied in medium to large urban areas where alternative modes are competitive & traffic congestion is a factor
- Can assess **broad range of policies**:
  - Improved transit service (e.g., headways, coverage, travel time)
  - Road pricing, gasoline taxes, etc.
  - Transit fare policy
  - Parking supply & cost
  - HOV policies

## Explanatory Variables in Mode Choice Models {.smaller}
Alternative Specific Variables

- Travel time
  - In-vehicle
  - Out-of-vehicle
  - Walk (access & egress)
  - Wait (initial & transfer)
- Out-of-pocket travel costs
  - Transit fare or “in-vehicle” auto cost
  - Parking cost
- Other factors? Reliability, safety, comfort, convenience, etc.

## Explanatory Variables in Mode Choice Models {.smaller}
Tripmaker Specific Variables

- Income
- Vehicle availability
- No. of vehicles in household
- Driver’s license? (0/1)
- Age
- Gender
- Occupation
- Household composition

## Modeled Alternatives: The Choice Set
The number & definition of modeled modes depends on

  - Problem application
  - Available data
  - Network modeling capabilities
- **At a minimum**, requires some representation of competition between auto & transit

## Auto Mode Representation {.smaller}
- Common to distinguish between drivers & passengers:
  - **Auto driver mode:** trip-maker drives a vehicle from origin to destination
  - **Auto passenger mode:** trip-maker is a passenger in  car from origin to destination
- Alternatively, we can distinguish between drive alone & shared trips
  - **Drive alone mode:** trip-maker is sole occupant of vehicle from origin to destination (single occupancy vehicle (SOV) trip)
  - **Shared-ride mode:** trip-maker is one of several vehicle occupants from origin to destination
    - **Car driver** for shared ride
    - **Car passenger** for shared ride with household member
    - **Car pooling:** driver or passenger in vehicle with non-household members

## Transit Mode Representation
- Possible ways to categorize transit include
    - **Local** (e.g., StarTran or Metro Transit) vs. **regional** (e.g., OMALiNK or N-E Ride)
    - **Surface shared right-of-way** (bus, streetcar) vs. **dedicated ROW** (subway, LRT, busway)
    - **Bus** vs. **rail**
    - **Regular service** vs. **express** vs. **other premium service**

## Mixed Modes
- Combined auto-transit modes exist, in which auto is used to access transit system
  - **Park & Ride:** trip-maker drives to a transit station & parks their vehicle at station
  - **Kiss & Ride:** trip-maker is driven as a passenger to a transit station & is dropped off there
- Auto access greatly expands  **catchment area** of transit services

## Other Modes {.smaller}
There has been an explosion of modes in the last decade

- Transportation network companies (TNCs): Uber, Lyft
  - Single ride
  - Pooled rides & van pools
- Regular taxis
- Motorcycles
- Jitneys
- Ferries, water taxis
- Non-motorized modes
  - Walking
  - Bicycling
  - E-bikes
  - E-Scooters

## Decision Structure
- Mode choice can be represented as **decision tree**
- Each node of tree represents an alternative & relationships among choices indicated via hierarchical tree structure (often called **nesting structure**)

## Alternative Decision Structures
![](../images/lecture6/alt-decision-structure.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model
A regional morning peak-period work trip mode choice model is a three-mode logit model as follows

d = auto-drive

p = auto passenger

t = transit

## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model 
$V_m$ = utility for mode m

$COST_m$ = out-of-pocket travel cost ($) for mode m

$IVTT_m$ = in-vehicle travel time (min.) for mode m

$OVTT_m$ = out-of-vehicle travel time (min.) for mode m

NVEH = avg. no. of vehicles per household in home zone

TWY = 1 if employment zone is located within the catchment area of a transitway station outside the CBD
           = 0 otherwise

REGION = 1 if home zone is located in a specific area
                = 0  otherwise


## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model {.smaller}
Systematic utility functions

$$𝑉_𝑑=−0.55−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇_𝑑−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑑+0.75×𝑁𝑉𝐸𝐻$$

$$𝑉_𝑝=−2.28−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇_𝑝−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑝−0.30×𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡
+0.45×𝑁𝑉𝐸𝐻$$

$$𝑉_𝑡=−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇_𝑡−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡−0.30×𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡+1.07×𝑇𝑊𝑌
−0.98×𝑅𝐸𝐺𝐼𝑂𝑁$$

## Example: Work Trip Mode Choice Model
![](../images/lecture6/mode-ex.png){fig-align="center"}

## Important Notes on Mode Choice Example {.smaller}
- Cost, IVTT, & OVTT are **generic variables**
  - Enter all utility with same parameter values (no OVTT for driver)
- NVEH is an **alternative specific variable**
  - Enters two utility functions with **different parameter values**
- There are **alternative specific constants** for drive & passenger modes but not transit
  - If there are M alternatives, we can statically identify M-1 alternative specific constants (ASC)
  - ASC account for unobserved but non-random variation – ASC will match **market share** for multinomial logit model

## Important Notes on Mode Choice Example {.smaller}
- Socio-economic variables **do not vary** between alternatives
  - If included in model, must enter as alternative specific variables
  - If included in model as generic variables, would add same utility to all alternatives & have no impact on choice probability
  - Can interact socio-economic variables with level of service (LOS) variables
    - E.g., travel cost / household income

## Calculating Value of Travel Time (VTT) from Utility Function {.smaller}
- We can calculate an implied VTT from model coefficients
- From our previous example

$$−0.57×𝐶𝑂𝑆𝑇($)=−0.20×𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇(𝑚𝑖𝑛)$$

- How many $ would one pay to reduce their travel time by one hour?

$$𝑉𝑇𝑇=𝛽_{𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒}/𝛽_{𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡} =(−0.20)/(−0.57)=$21/ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟$$

- Similarly, VTT for OVTT = $31.6/hour
- **Question:** How do you think VTT for IVTT compares for **auto** vs. **transit** modes?

## Direct & Cross Elasticity
- **Direct elasticity:** direct effect of changing a variable value related to a good on demand for the **same good**
  - E.g., elasticity of transit demand wrt transit fare, transit travel time, or transit headway
- **Cross elasticity:** effect of changing a variable value related to a good on demand for a **different good**
 - E.g., elasticity of transit demand wrt auto travel time

## Logit -  Direct Elasticity
- Direct elasticity of the probability of an individual $n$ choosing alternative $i$ wrt a change in an attribute/independent variable $X_{ik}$ with coefficient $\beta_k$ (ignoring $n$ subscripts for simplicity)

$$e_{direct} = \frac{\partial P_i}{\partial X_{ik}}\frac{X_{ik}}{P_i} = (1-P_i)X_{ik}\beta_k$$

## Logit -  Cross Elasticity {.smaller}
- Cross elasticity of the probability of an individual $n$ choosing alternative $i$ wrt a change in an attribute/independent variable $X_{jk}$ with coefficient $\beta_k$ for a **different alternative**

$$e_{cross}=-P_j X_{jk} \beta_k$$

- Above is same regardless of alternative $i$. I.e., **all** modes have the same cross-elasticity wrt an attribute $k$ of mode alternative $j$
  - Above results from independence of irrelevant alternatives (**IIA**) property of basis logit model

## Forecasting Mode Choice (Model Application) {.smaller}
- Mode choice models generate choice probability predictions for individuals
- For planning purposes, we are interested in total number of people in a zone or study area likely to choose each mode
- Must aggregate individual choices
  - Total enumeration/microsimulation
  - Sample enumeration
  - Naïve aggregation
  - Classify with naïve aggregation

## Total Enumeration
- Simplest method but often not practical
- Enumerate all individuals in study area
- Calculate mode choice probabilities
- Sum probabilities over all individuals
- **Problem:** extremely expensive to survey all individuals & difficult to simulate them
- Microsimulation models can be used to simulate individuals

## Sample Enumeration
- Second best to total enumeration
- Requires representative sample of population
- Calculate mode choice probabilities for sample
- Sample prediction of mode shares can be substituted for population prediction
- **Problem:** How to synthesize a sample for a future year?

## Naive Aggregation
- Treat individual choice model as an aggregate model
- Use zonal averages for variables as inputs to compute “average” zonal probability
- Problem: Choice probabilities are non-linear functions of variables so aggregation bias
- Avoid this method!

## Classification with Naive Aggregation
- Classify population into relatively homogenous groups
- E.g., by vehicle ownership & transit availability
- Determine variable averages for each classification group
- Use group averages to compute average mode shares
- Sum mode shares
- Most common method used in practice

## Classification with Naïve Aggregation Example {.smaller}
A work trip mode split logit model includes the no. of hh. vehicles (NVEH) and whether a worker has a driver’s license (DLIC) as variables. The aggregation/forecasting procedure used is to:

- Divide workers into “n” NVEH & DLIC categories
- Estimate percentage of workers in each category by O-D pair
- Compute mode choice probabilities for each category
- Compute weighted average mode splits for each O-D pair

## Aggregation Bias
- Consider a zone in which people are identical except for their income, and that the probability of a person using transit depends only on the person’s income.

![](../images/lecture6/agg-bias-1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Aggregation Bias
- Bias becomes worse for more heterogenous populations

![](../images/lecture6/agg-bias-2.png){fig-align="center"}

## Forecasting Example {.smaller}
$$𝑉_𝑎=\beta_1+\beta_2 𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_a+\beta_4 𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑎+\beta_5 ((𝑂𝑃𝑇𝐶_a)/𝐼𝑁𝐶)+\beta_6 𝐴𝑂$$

$$𝑉_𝑡=\beta_3 𝐼𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡+\beta_4 𝑂𝑉𝑇𝑇_𝑡+\beta_5 ((𝑂𝑃𝑇𝐶_𝑡)/𝐼𝑁𝐶)$$

- IVTT = in-vehicle travel time
- OVTT  = out-of-vehicle travel time
- OPTC = out-of-pocket travel cost
- INC = household income
- AO = auto ownership level

## Forecasting Example - Full Enumeration & Naive Aggregation {.smaller}
In this example, naive aggregation results in 3% **overprediction** of auto

![](../images/lecture6/tota-enum.png){.absolute bottom="50" left="0" width=50%}

![](../images/lecture6/naive-agg.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width=50%}

## Forecasting Example - Full Enumeration & Classification with Naive Aggregation {.smaller}
In this example, classification with naive aggregation results in <1% **overprediction** of auto

![](../images/lecture6/tota-enum.png){.absolute bottom="50" left="0" width=50%}

![](../images/lecture6/class-enum.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width=50%}

## Destination Choice
- Like mode choice, we can consider the **trip distribution** process using disaggregate choice models
- **Destination choice models** attempt to represent the decision-process by individuals when deciding where to make a trip

![](../images/lecture6/destination-choice.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width=75%}

## Destination Choice
- Unfortunately, destination choice is more complex than mode choice due to **choice set explosion**
- We can address challenge by making use of logit properties to draw a **random sample of alternatives**

![](../images/lecture6/destination-choice-2.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width=75%}

## Joint Mode-Destination Choice
Often mode-destination choice a **joint process**: choosing to walk will affect destination choice & choosing a close destination will affect mode choice

![](../images/lecture6/mode-dest-choice.png){.absolute bottom="50" right="50" width=80%}

## Other Choices {.smaller}
- Home location choice (**multinomial logit**) – similar to destination choice
- Vehicle ownership choice? 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. vehicles (**ordered logit**)
- Departure time choice? 8AM, 9AM, 10AM, etc. (**ordered logit**)
- Party size choice? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. persons (**ordered logit**)
- Choice set formation
  - What destinations do I consider? Do I consider only destinations within my neighborhood? Do I consider only destinations within a certain distance or travel time?
