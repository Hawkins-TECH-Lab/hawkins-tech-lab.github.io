## We can examine trip generation in several ways... {.smaller}
:::incremental
1. Total number of trips generated in a TAZ based on zone properties: population, employment, number of cars, etc. (method: **regression**)

</br></br></br></br>

2. Trip frequency choice by households (method: **discrete choice**)
![](../images/lecture3/van.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="500" width=25%}
:::

## Academic Vs. Practitioner Considerations
:::incremental
- Practitioner struggle deciding between a **theoretically sound** but **difficult to implement** set of models &  a more pragmatic modelling approach reflecting the **limitations of the data, time, & resources** available for a study
- Models are too complex
- Implies that **heuristic approaches**, rules of thumb, &  ad hoc procedures are easier to understand &  therefore **preferable**
:::

## Planning & Monitoring with the Help of Models
![](../images/lecture3/model_process.png){fig-align="center"}

## Classic 4-Step Travel Model
![](../images/lecture3/4_step_model.png){fig-align="center"}

## Classic 4-Step Travel Model {.smaller}
- 1) Trip generation, 2) Trip distribution, 3) Modal split, & 4) Traffic assignment
- Generally recognized that travel decisions are **not actually taken** in this type of sequence
- Model sequencing depends on the **form of the utility function** assumed to govern all these travel choices
- Four-stage model is seen as concentrating attention on only a limited range of travellers’ responses

## Classic 4-Step Travel Model {.smaller}
- Current thinking requires analysis of a wider range of responses to transport problems & schemes
- For example, when faced with increased congestion a trip maker can respond with a range of simple changes to:
  - **Route** followed to avoid congestion or take advantage of new links - choice of parking place or combination of services in the case of public transport
  - **Mode** used to get to the destination
  - **Departure time** to avoid the most congested part of the peak
  - **Trip destination** to a less congested area
  - **Trip frequency** by undertaking the trip on another day, perhaps combining it with other activities

## Trip Definitions {.smaller}
::: incremental
- **Home-Based (HB) Trip**: A trip which either starts or ends at the home
  - Home-based work
  - Home-based grade school
  - Home-based university
  - Home-based shopping
  - Home-based other
- **Non-Home-Based (NHB) Trip**: A trip which neither starts nor ends at the home
- **Trip production**: The home end of a HB trip or origin of a NHB trip
- **Trip attraction**: The non-home end of a HB trip or the destination of a NHB trip
:::

## Trip Production & Attraction
![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_attraction.png){fig-align="center"}

## Trip Production & Attraction
![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_1.png){fig-align="left" width=45%}
![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_2.png){fig-align="right" width=45%}

## Origin/Destination Vs. Production/Attraction
- **Production** & **attraction** approach works fine when dealing with 24-hour work trips
- Lose **directionality** when dealing with peak-period flows
- Typically use **origin/destination** approach

<!---
If we remove a trip, Zone 1 produces a trip to zone 2 but in what direction?

![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_3.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="300" width=30%}

## Trip Purpose {.smaller}
::: incremental
- For HB trips:
  - Travel to work
  - Travel to school or college (education trips)
  - Shopping trips
  - Social &  recreational trips
  - Escort trips (to accompany or collect someone else)
  - Other trips (healthcare &  personal business)
- First two are usually considered **compulsory (mandatory)** trips &  we build skeleton schedules around them
- Other usually considered **discretionary (optional) trips**
:::

## Factors Affecting Trip Generation {.smaller}
- Since trip generation performed before distribution &  mode split, usually **do not** use travel times, costs, etc.

#### Personal trip productions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
  - Income
  - Car ownership
  - Family size
  - Household structure
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
  - Value of land
  - Residential density
  - Accessibility
:::
:::

- First 4 considered in most **household trip generation models**
- Value of land &  residential density often considered in **zonal studies**
- Accessibility rarely included in models but makes trip generation **elastic** (responsive) to changes in transport system

## Factors Affecting Trip Generation {.smaller}
#### Personal trip attractions
  - Floorspace available for industrial, commercial, &  other services
  - Zonal employment

#### Freight trip production & attraction
  - Number of employees
  - Number of sales
  - Roofed area of firm
  - Total area of firm

- What about type of firm? Accessibility? Curiously, few applications in freight models despite it seeming logical that different products have different transport requirements

## Trip Generation Aggregation {.smaller}
- **Temporal aggregation**: hourly, peak/off-peak, daily, weekly
- **Spatial aggregation**:
  - Persons: by income, driver’s license, vehicle ownership, occupation type, household size, etc.
  - Households: by income, vehicle ownership, household size, number of workers, with/without children
  - **Zones**: by location (e.g., downtown, suburb), major trip generator (e.g., hospital, stadium)
- Most operational models use either zones or households. **Why?**

## Trip Generation Approaches
### Three major operational approaches
- Trip rate models
- Cross-classification models
- Regression models

## Trip Rate Models {.smaller}
- Computed from observed data by simply dividing number of trips by selected explanatory variable or population
  - Home-to-work trips for retail employees = Total observed trips by retail employees / Total retail employment
  - Trip rates can be geographically stratified (i.e., different rates used for different areas of the city) &  may combine multiple factors

- Total shopping trips=

<p style="text-align: center;">
A1 ×Population in Downtown Area <br>
+ A2×Population in Inner Suburbs <br>
+ A3×Population in Outer Suburbs
</p>

![](../images/lecture3/ite_trip_generation.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width=25%}

## Trip Rate Models {.smaller}
- **Constant trip generation rate** is estimated from observed data
- Forecasts can be done
  - Assuming **trip generation rate by category is fixed**
    - Trips attracted to a shopping mall = $A_s \times {MallFloorArea}$
    - Trips generated by a zone = $\sum_k A_k \times HH With Cars \text{ where k} = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.$
  - Assuming **overall trip generation rate is fixed**
    - Trips generated in a zone = $t_i$
    - Trips generated in the future $T_i = t_i \times PopulationGrowthRate$

## Cross-Classification Models {.smaller}
- Classify households (or persons) by one or more variables - often **household size** &  **number of vehicles**
- Assume trip rates are **relatively constant** within each group
- Compute **average trip rate** for each group
- Zonal trips = sum of trips generated by all groups found in the zone
- **Note:** trip rate model is a cross-classification model by **trip type** not **trip maker**

## Cross-Classification Models
![](../images/lecture3/cross_classification.png){fig-align="center"}

## Linear Regression Models
- Use regression to estimate “best fit” linear regression between **# of trips** &  one or more **explanatory variables**
$$T=1.229+1.379V$$
- Where $T$ is daily trip productions per household for all purposes &  $V$ is the # of vehicles per household
$$A=61.4+0.93E$$
- Where $A$ is **daily work trip attractions** for a given zone &  $E$ is **total zonal employment**

## Parameter Signs & Theoretical Expectations
- Model specification should “make sense” from behavioral & theoretical perspectives
- Variables included should have a causal influence on the dependent variable
- Parameters should have expected signs (+ or -)
- Parameters should have reasonable magnitudes

## Parameter Signs & Theoretical Expecations {.smaller}
:::incremental
- Do these parameter signs make sense?
$$Daily HH Trips= 3 Persons In HH − 0.5 HH Vehicles$$
- **No**: We expect trip making to increase with # of vehicles
- Does this parameter magnitude make sense?
$$Daily HH Work Trips=0.2 HH Workers$$
- **No**: We expect each worker to make approx. 2 trips per day
- Does it make sense to include No. of HH workers in the model? 
$$Daily HH School Trips=1+0.2 HH Workers$$
- **No**: There’s no logical/causal relationship between no. of workers &  school trips
:::

## Or Could The School Model Make Sense?... {.smaller}
#### International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria:
- Women with no schooling - **4.5 children**
- Women with 2-3 years of primary school – **3 children**
- Women who complete one or two years of secondary school - **1.9 children** (replacement rate is 2.1 children) 
- With one or two years of college, the average childbearing rate falls even further, to **1.7**
- When women enter the workforce, start businesses, inherit assets, &  otherwise interact with men on an equal footing, children per household fades even more dramatically

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}
#### Some important considerations
- Zonal models can explain **variation between zones** 
  - For this reason, only successful if inter-zonal variations reflect real reasons for trip variation
  - Necessary that zones are homogeneous in socioeconomic composition &  represent a wide range of conditions
  - **Major problem** is that main variation in person trips is intra-zonal
- **Role of intercept**: One would expect estimated regression line to pass through zero but large intercepts are common. **Why?**
- **Null zones**: No information about certain dependent variables (e.g., no. HB trips in a non-residential zone). These zones must be excluded from analysis

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}
#### Some important considerations cont…
- **Zonal totals vs. zonal means**: when formulating model, analyst has choice between **aggregate** or **total variables**, such as trips per zone or cars per zone vs. rates, such as trips per household or cars per household in the zone
- Important difference:
$$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_{1i}+\beta_2 X_{2i}+…+\beta_k X_{𝑘𝑖}+E_𝑖 \text{ (total trip model)}$$
$$𝑦_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1i+\beta_2 x_2i+…+\beta_k x_{𝑘𝑖}+e_i \text{ (trip rate model)}$$
- Where $y_i=Y_i/H_i$, $x_i=X_i/H_i$, &  $e_𝑖=E_i/H_i$

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}
#### Even more important considerations...
- Similar equations &  parameters have a similar interpretation
- **However**, unless $H_i$ is constant across zones, constant variance condition cannot hold for error terms in total trips model
- Aggregate variables reflect size of zone, thus magnitude of error depends on size of zone - heteroskedasticity (variability in variance)
- Using a $1/H_i$ multiplier normalizes the model &  reduces heteroskedasticity because model becomes independent of zone size
- Aggregate variable models often yield higher $R^2$ but spurious effect from zone size helping to explain total trips
- **DO NOT** mix rate &  aggregate variables in same model

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}
- Even when rates used, zonal regression is conditioned by nature &  size of zones (**spatial aggregation problem**)
- Interzonal variance diminishes with larger zone size

![](../images/lecture3/zone_regression_table.png){fig-align="center"}

## Household-Based Regression {.smaller}
- Intra-zonal variation may be reduced by decreasing zone size but there are **two problems**
  - **More expensive models** in terms of data collection, calibration, &  operation
  - **Larger sampling errors** (regression to mean with larger samples, so small zone means not capturing average person), which is assumed non-existent by multiple linear regression model
- **Household** used rather than **person** because we have a hard time incorporating **intra-household dynamics** (e.g., vehicle availability) - Some advances but still not great
- Can decide on variables in **step-wise process** but must be careful - May exclude a variable with slightly lower prediction that is easier to forecast
- Opposite approach of including all variables &  removing variables can be a better approach

## Validity of Linear Regression Assumption {.smaller}
- Regression models are easy to construct &  use
- **However**, underlying assumptions may be wrong
  - Linearity
  - No correlations between explanatory variables
- Residuals are estimates of error in model obtained from subtracting predicted from observed dependent variable values
  - Residual $e_i = y_{i,observed} – y_{i,predicted}$
  - Residuals should be normally distributed with constant variance – can plot a histogram to check
  - Residuals should be uncorrelated with any explanatory variable – can plot residuals vs. explanatory variables

## Histogram of Residuals
![](../images/lecture3/histogram_residuals.png){fig-align="center"}

## Residuals Vs. Explanatory Variables
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_variance.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example {.smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_example.png){fig-align="center"}
:::
::: {.column }
- Three variables are defined $X$, $Y$, &  $Z$ where $X$ & $Z$ are **explanatory variables** & $Y$ is the **dependent variable**
:::
:::

## First Model $y = aX + b$ {.smaller}
- $R^2 = 0.506$ means that we are explaining **50.6%** of the variance in y with the explanatory variables in the model
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_results_1.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="0"}
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_plot.png){.absolute top="200" right="0" width=45%}

## Analysis of Residuals Vs. X {.smaller}
- Looks like a constant variance across values of $X$...
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_x_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

## Analysis of Residuals Vs. Z {.smaller}
- Residuals **not constant** over different values of $Z$ (so we should try to include $Z$ as another explanatory variable)
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_z_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

## Second Model $y = aX bZ + c$ {.smaller}
- $R^2 = 0.761$ means that we are explaining **76.1%** of the variance in $y$ with the explanatory variables in the model
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_results_2.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="0"}

## Analysis of Residuals Vs. X & Z$ {.smaller}
- Now residuals don’t change over different values of X or Z!

![](../images/lecture3/residuals_x_z_2.png){fig-align="center" width=40%}

## Dealing With Non-Linear Relationships

![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_1.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width=25%}

## Transform the Explanatory Variable (add $x^2$ term)

![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_2.png){.absolute bottom="50" right="0" width=25%}

## Other Transformations {.smaller}
- Log transformation, $x’ = ln(x)$ if effects starts strong at low x but reaches limiting return with further increases in $x$ (often used for income variables)
- Dummy variables:
  - $X_1$ = 0 if vehicle ownership = 0 &  1 if vehicle ownership > 0
  - $X_2$ = 1 if married &  0 otherwise
- Variable interactions
  - $X_1$ = age in years $\times$ income less than $30k
  - $X_2$ = age in years $\times$ income $30k-$60k
  - $X_3$ = age in years $\times$ income over $60k
  - $X_4$ = gender (male) $\times$ have fulltime job
  - $X_5$ = gender (male) $\times$ have parttime job

## Non-Linearity in Trip Generation Variables
- Linear regression assumes each independent variable exerts a **linear influence** on the dependent variable
- Not easy to detect non-linearity because relationship can appear linear until other variables enter into the model (i.e., it is representing the **effect of multiple variables** with a linear overall effect)
- **Multivariate graphs** can be helpful to identify non-linearity

## Example
::: {style="font-size: 0.5em;"}
Consider the variables **trips per household** ($Y$), **number of workers** ($𝑋_1$), and **number of vehicles** ($𝑋_2$). Successive steps were performed of a stepwise model estimation. Values (in parenthesis) are t-ratios. In the step 4 model, $Z_1$ takes the value 1 for households with one car and 0 otherwise and $Z_2$ takes the value 1 for households with two or more cars and 0 otherwise. We can see that zero car households will have the value 0 for both $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. Even without the higher $R^2$, the step 4 model would be preferred because it clearly demonstrates there is a **non-linear effect** that’s ignored by $𝑋_2$.

![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_3.png){fig-align="right"}

## Variable Selection & Model Building {.smaller}
- **Problem**: Choose the set of appropriate explanatory variables from a set of candidate variables - **variable selection**
- Possible approaches
  - Exploring all possible variables - many combinations
  - Stepwise regression -> construct a sequence of regression models by adding or removing variables at each step
    - **Forward selection**: add variables to the model one at a time until there are no remaining candidate variables that improve fit
    - **Backward elimination**: begin with all possible variables &  remove the least significant variables
- **Are there problems with these approaches?**

## Variable Specification & Forecasting {.smaller}
- Consider variables **important for explaining differences** in trip-making decisions
- **Frequency** & **data plotting** gives idea of variability with respect to different variables
- Specify variables as per relationship
  - Continuous
  - Ordered
  - Discrete
- Variable choice depends on availability of observed information & capacity to forecast
- Statistical significance tests
- Model goodness of fit can be used to identify impact of specific variables

## Model Validation {.smaller}
- A good way to validate a model is to compare **observed vs. modeled values** for some groupings of the data
- Better than comparing totals because **biases may cancel** in that case (high prediction cancels with low prediction)
- Errors are reasonably low (i.e., less than 30%)
- Large bias could be addressed by adjusting model parameters, but it’s not easy because there are no clear rules

![](../images/lecture3/validation_table.png){fig-align="center" width=40%}

## Model Validation - Learning From Machine Learning
- Transportation planning field starting to adopt methods from **machine learning** field, including for validation
  - **Leave-one-out** (LOO) &  **k-folds cross-validation** to get mean &  std. dev. 
  - **Score** (R2 for linear regression)
  - **Mean absolute error** (MAE)

## Obtaining Zonal Totals {.smaller}
- Simple process for zone-based models because already modeling total trips
- Requires extra step for household-based models – multiplying by number of households
  - $T_i=H_i(0.91+1.44\bar{X}_{1i}+1.07\bar{X}_{2i}$ where $T_i$ is the total number of HB trips in zone $i$
  - With dummy variables, we need to know the number of households in each group
  - $T_i=H_i(0.84+1.41X)+0.75H_{1i}+3.14H_{2i}$ where $H_{1i}$ is the number of one vehicle households & $H_{2i}$ is the number of two vehicle households in zone $i$

## Matching Generations & Attractions {.smaller}
- Models do not guarantee, by default, that total trips originating in a zone (the origins O_𝑖) at all zones will equal the total trips attracted (the destinations 𝐷_𝑗)
- Following expression may not hold
$$\sum_i O_i=\sum_j D_j$$ 
- Generally assumed that trip generation models are **better** than trip attraction models
- Total trips are then $T=\sum_i O_i$ & a factor applied to trip attraction
$$f=T/\sum_j D_j$$

- This equality is necessary for the next model step: **trip distribution**

## Growth Factor Modeling {.smaller}
- Growth factor method given by
$$T_{i+t}=F_tT_i$$
- Where $T_i$ is total trips at time $i$, $T_{i+t}$ is total trips at time $i+t$, & $F_i$ is a growth factor. Determining total current trips is a simple process but forecasting future trips (i.e., $F_t$) is a **big challenge**
- $F_t$ is related to variables such as population ($P$), income ($I$), & car ownership ($C$)
$$F_t = \frac{f(P_t,I_t,c_t)}{f(P_i,I_i,c_i)}$$ 

## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}
Consider a zone with 250 households with vehicles and 250 households without vehicles. Assuming we know the average trip generation rates of each group:

- Vehicle-owning households produce 6.0 trips/day
- Non-vehicle-owning households produce 2.5 trips/day

We can determine the current number of trips as
$$T_i = 250 \times 2.5 + 250 \times 6.0 = 2125 \text{ trips/day}$$

## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}
- Let’s assume that all households in the future have a vehicle. We can then estimate a simple multiplicative growth factor as
$$F_t = 1/0.5 = 2.0$$
$$T_{i+t} = 2 \times 2125 = 4250 \text{ trips/day}$$

- Growth factor methods are crude &  generally used in practice for **external trips** where additional information is not available

## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}
- Let us also assume that in the future all households will have a vehicle, but income &  population remain unchanged

$$T_i = 6 \times 500 = 3000 \text{ trips/day}$$

- **But do we expect non-vehicle households to make this many more trips if income is not changing?**

## Stability & Updating Trip Generation Model {.smaller}
- **Temporal stability**: Population/socio-economic structure changes over time & affects trip rates
- **Geographic stability**: Trip-making patterns vary from place to place
- Updating trip generation models
  - If models were developed using **old data**, it is necessary to update the model for present situation
  - Best way to re-estimate trip generation model using **present data**
  - If sufficient data is **not available**, we can update previously estimated model using **small present data sample**

## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}
- Standard variables are household totals, household size (and structure), number of vehicles owned, &  household income
- **However**, there are many other factors that can be explored regarding household structure
  - Social circumstances likely affect travel
  - Personal living alone will have a different set of tradeoffs &  coordination patterns than person living in with others
  - Multi-person household dynamics will vary depending on structure – several students living together may not coordinate trips in same way as a family
  - Elderly people living with younger people may be more engaged outside the home than those living alone or with similarly aged persons

## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}
- **How do life course events affect trips?**
  - Appearance of a pre-school children
  - Time when youngest child reaches school age
  - Time when youth leaves home &  lives alone, with other young adults, or marries
  - Time when all children of a couple have left home but couple has not retired yet
  - Time when all members of a household reach retirement age
- Important factors for identifying/classifying households as being in similar life stage &  potentially having more **homogeneous travel patterns**
- **What about overall aging of population?** Age tends to be associated with decline in mobility in change in lifestyle

## Trip Generation Inelastic In Most Models
- Independent of the level of service provided in the transport system
- Probably **unrealistic** but **only recently** techniques have been developed which can take systematic account of these (induced demand) effects

## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}
- **Trip or journey**: one-way movement from an origin point to a destination point
  - **Home-based (HB) trip**: trip with the home (or hotel for a nonresident) being either the trip origin or destination
  - **Non-home-based (NHB) trip**: trip where neither end of the trip is the home
  - **Trip production**: defined as the home end of an HB trip or as the origin of an NHB
  - **Trip attraction**: defined as the non-home end of an HB trip or the destination of an NHB
  - **Trip generation**: total number of trips generated by households in a zone, both HB &  NHB

## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}
- **Activity**: short stay at a particular location
  - Usually has a purpose associated to it: work, study, shopping, leisure, etc.
- **Tour or trip chain**: a sequence of linked trips
- **Tours** & **activities** correspond more closely with the idea of travel as a derived demand than do the first concepts
  - Contemporary models are generally interested in **tours** rather than **trips**. **Why?**

## Trip Generation & Accessibility {.smaller}
- Classical transport planning (4-step) model can incorporate an **iterative process** between distribution & assignment, leaving trip generation unaltered
- True even in most contemporary models, which attempt to appropriately solve supply-demand equilibrium problem
- **Disadvantage**: changes to network assumed to have no effect on trip productions &  attractions
  - E.g., Extension of a subway line would not generate more trips between that zone &  other zones
  - May hold for compulsory trips but unlikely to hold for discretionary trips

## Trip Generation & Accessibility {.smaller}
- Attempts made to incorporate an **accessibility measure** into trip generation by replacing $O_i = f(H_i)$ by $f(H_i,A_i$ where $H_i$ are household characteristics & $A_i$ is an accessibility measure
- Accessibility generally defined by $A_i = \sum_j f(E_j, C_{ij})$ where $E_j$ is an attraction measure for zone $j$ &  $C_{ij}$ is a **generalized cost of travel** between zones $i$ & $j$.
  - Often give wrong sign or non-significant results due to unresolved model dynamics &  problems from using cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data
  - Leads to **activity-based models** &  trip frequency/scheduling choice models (discussed in **CIVE864**)
