## We can examine trip generation in several ways... {.smaller}

::: incremental
1.  Total number of trips generated in a TAZ based on zone properties: population, employment, number of cars, etc. (method: **regression**) ![](../images/lecture3/omaha_taz.png){.absolute top="225" right="0" width="25%"} </br></br></br></br>

2.  Trip frequency choice by households (method: **discrete choice**) ![](../images/lecture3/van.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="500" width="25%"}
:::

## Academic Vs. Practitioner Considerations

::: incremental
-   Practitioner struggle deciding between a **theoretically sound** but **difficult to implement** set of models & a more pragmatic modelling approach reflecting the **limitations of the data, time, & resources** available for a study
-   Models are too complex
-   Implies that **heuristic approaches**, rules of thumb, & ad hoc procedures are easier to understand & therefore **preferable**
:::

## Planning & Monitoring with the Help of Models

![](../images/lecture3/model_process.png){fig-align="center"}

## Classic 4-Step Travel Model

![](../images/lecture3/4_step_model.png){fig-align="center"}

## Classic 4-Step Travel Model {.smaller}

-   

    1)  Trip generation, 2) Trip distribution, 3) Modal split, & 4) Traffic assignment

-   Generally recognized that travel decisions are **not actually taken** in this type of sequence

-   Model sequencing depends on the **form of the utility function** assumed to govern all these travel choices

-   Four-stage model is seen as concentrating attention on only a limited range of travellers’ responses

## Classic 4-Step Travel Model {.smaller}

-   Current thinking requires analysis of a wider range of responses to transport problems & schemes
-   For example, when faced with increased congestion a trip maker can respond with a range of simple changes to:
    -   **Route** followed to avoid congestion or take advantage of new links - choice of parking place or combination of services in the case of public transport
    -   **Mode** used to get to the destination
    -   **Departure time** to avoid the most congested part of the peak
    -   **Trip destination** to a less congested area
    -   **Trip frequency** by undertaking the trip on another day, perhaps combining it with other activities

## Trip Definitions {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   **Home-Based (HB) Trip**: A trip which either starts or ends at the home
    -   Home-based work
    -   Home-based grade school
    -   Home-based university
    -   Home-based shopping
    -   Home-based other
-   **Non-Home-Based (NHB) Trip**: A trip which neither starts nor ends at the home
-   **Trip production**: The home end of a HB trip or origin of a NHB trip
-   **Trip attraction**: The non-home end of a HB trip or the destination of a NHB trip
:::

## Trip Production & Attraction

![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_attraction.png){fig-align="center"}

## Trip Production & Attraction

![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_1.png){fig-align="left" width="45%"} ![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_2.png){fig-align="right" width="45%"}

## Origin/Destination Vs. Production/Attraction

-   **Production** & **attraction** approach works fine when dealing with 24-hour work trips
-   Lose **directionality** when dealing with peak-period flows
-   Typically use **origin/destination** approach

```{=html}
<!---
If we remove a trip, Zone 1 produces a trip to zone 2 but in what direction?
-->
```

![](../images/lecture3/trip_production_3.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="300" width="30%"}

## Trip Purpose {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   For HB trips:
    -   Travel to work
    -   Travel to school or college (education trips)
    -   Shopping trips
    -   Social & recreational trips
    -   Escort trips (to accompany or collect someone else)
    -   Other trips (healthcare & personal business)
-   First two are usually considered **compulsory (mandatory)** trips & we build skeleton schedules around them
-   Other usually considered **discretionary (optional) trips**
:::

## Factors Affecting Trip Generation {.smaller}

-   Since trip generation performed before distribution & mode split, usually **do not** use travel times, costs, etc.

#### Personal trip productions

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Income
-   Car ownership
-   Family size
-   Household structure
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Value of land
-   Residential density
-   Accessibility
:::
:::::

-   First 4 considered in most **household trip generation models**
-   Value of land & residential density often considered in **zonal studies**
-   Accessibility rarely included in models but makes trip generation **elastic** (responsive) to changes in transport system

## Factors Affecting Trip Generation {.smaller}

#### Personal trip attractions

-   Floorspace available for industrial, commercial, & other services
-   Zonal employment

#### Freight trip production & attraction

-   Number of employees

-   Number of sales

-   Roofed area of firm

-   Total area of firm

-   What about type of firm? Accessibility? Curiously, few applications in freight models despite it seeming logical that different products have different transport requirements

## Trip Generation Aggregation {.smaller}

-   **Temporal aggregation**: hourly, peak/off-peak, daily, weekly
-   **Spatial aggregation**:
    -   Persons: by income, driver’s license, vehicle ownership, occupation type, household size, etc.
    -   Households: by income, vehicle ownership, household size, number of workers, with/without children
    -   **Zones**: by location (e.g., downtown, suburb), major trip generator (e.g., hospital, stadium)
-   Most operational models use either zones or households. **Why?**

## Trip Generation Approaches

### Three major operational approaches

-   Trip rate models
-   Cross-classification models
-   Regression models

## Trip Rate Models {.smaller}

-   Computed from observed data by simply dividing number of trips by selected explanatory variable or population
    -   Home-to-work trips for retail employees = Total observed trips by retail employees / Total retail employment
    -   Trip rates can be geographically stratified (i.e., different rates used for different areas of the city) & may combine multiple factors
-   Total shopping trips=

<p style="text-align: center;">

A1 ×Population in Downtown Area <br> + A2×Population in Inner Suburbs <br> + A3×Population in Outer Suburbs

</p>

![](../images/lecture3/ite_trip_generation.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width="25%"}

## Trip Rate Models {.smaller}

-   **Constant trip generation rate** is estimated from observed data
-   Forecasts can be done
    -   Assuming **trip generation rate by category is fixed**
        -   Trips attracted to a shopping mall = $A_s \times {MallFloorArea}$
        -   Trips generated by a zone = $\sum_k A_k \times HH With Cars \text{ where k} = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.$
    -   Assuming **overall trip generation rate is fixed**
        -   Trips generated in a zone = $t_i$
        -   Trips generated in the future $T_i = t_i \times PopulationGrowthRate$

## Cross-Classification Models {.smaller}

-   Classify households (or persons) by one or more variables - often **household size** & **number of vehicles**
-   Assume trip rates are **relatively constant** within each group
-   Compute **average trip rate** for each group
-   Zonal trips = sum of trips generated by all groups found in the zone
-   **Note:** trip rate model is a cross-classification model by **trip type** not **trip maker**

## Cross-Classification Models

![](../images/lecture3/cross_classification.png){fig-align="center"}

## Linear Regression Models

-   Use regression to estimate “best fit” linear regression between **\# of trips** & one or more **explanatory variables** $$T=1.229+1.379V$$
-   Where $T$ is daily trip productions per household for all purposes & $V$ is the \# of vehicles per household $$A=61.4+0.93E$$
-   Where $A$ is **daily work trip attractions** for a given zone & $E$ is **total zonal employment**

## Parameter Signs & Theoretical Expectations

-   Model specification should “make sense” from behavioral & theoretical perspectives
-   Variables included should have a causal influence on the dependent variable
-   Parameters should have expected signs (+ or -)
-   Parameters should have reasonable magnitudes

## Parameter Signs & Theoretical Expecations {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Do these parameter signs make sense? $$Daily HH Trips= 3 Persons In HH − 0.5 HH Vehicles$$
-   **No**: We expect trip making to increase with \# of vehicles
-   Does this parameter magnitude make sense? $$Daily HH Work Trips=0.2 HH Workers$$
-   **No**: We expect each worker to make approx. 2 trips per day
-   Does it make sense to include No. of HH workers in the model? $$Daily HH School Trips=1+0.2 HH Workers$$
-   **No**: There’s no logical/causal relationship between no. of workers & school trips
:::

## Or Could The School Model Make Sense?... {.smaller}

#### International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria:

-   Women with no schooling - **4.5 children**
-   Women with 2-3 years of primary school – **3 children**
-   Women who complete one or two years of secondary school - **1.9 children** (replacement rate is 2.1 children)
-   With one or two years of college, the average childbearing rate falls even further, to **1.7**
-   When women enter the workforce, start businesses, inherit assets, & otherwise interact with men on an equal footing, children per household fades even more dramatically

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}

#### Some important considerations

-   Zonal models can explain **variation between zones**
    -   For this reason, only successful if inter-zonal variations reflect real reasons for trip variation
    -   Necessary that zones are homogeneous in socioeconomic composition & represent a wide range of conditions
    -   **Major problem** is that main variation in person trips is intra-zonal
-   **Role of intercept**: One would expect estimated regression line to pass through zero but large intercepts are common. **Why?**
-   **Null zones**: No information about certain dependent variables (e.g., no. HB trips in a non-residential zone). These zones must be excluded from analysis

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}

#### Some important considerations cont…

-   **Zonal totals vs. zonal means**: when formulating model, analyst has choice between **aggregate** or **total variables**, such as trips per zone or cars per zone vs. rates, such as trips per household or cars per household in the zone
-   Important difference: $$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_{1i}+\beta_2 X_{2i}+…+\beta_k X_{𝑘𝑖}+E_𝑖 \text{ (total trip model)}$$ $$𝑦_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_1i+\beta_2 x_2i+…+\beta_k x_{𝑘𝑖}+e_i \text{ (trip rate model)}$$
-   Where $y_i=Y_i/H_i$, $x_i=X_i/H_i$, & $e_𝑖=E_i/H_i$

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}

#### Even more important considerations...

-   Similar equations & parameters have a similar interpretation
-   **However**, unless $H_i$ is constant across zones, constant variance condition cannot hold for error terms in total trips model
-   Aggregate variables reflect size of zone, thus magnitude of error depends on size of zone - heteroskedasticity (variability in variance)
-   Using a $1/H_i$ multiplier normalizes the model & reduces heteroskedasticity because model becomes independent of zone size
-   Aggregate variable models often yield higher $R^2$ but spurious effect from zone size helping to explain total trips
-   **DO NOT** mix rate & aggregate variables in same model

## Zonal-Based Multiple Regression {.smaller}

-   Even when rates used, zonal regression is conditioned by nature & size of zones (**spatial aggregation problem**)
-   Interzonal variance diminishes with larger zone size

![](../images/lecture3/zone_regression_table.png){fig-align="center"}

## Household-Based Regression {.smaller}

-   Intra-zonal variation may be reduced by decreasing zone size but there are **two problems**
    -   **More expensive models** in terms of data collection, calibration, & operation
    -   **Larger sampling errors** (regression to mean with larger samples, so small zone means not capturing average person), which is assumed non-existent by multiple linear regression model
-   **Household** used rather than **person** because we have a hard time incorporating **intra-household dynamics** (e.g., vehicle availability) - Some advances but still not great
-   Can decide on variables in **step-wise process** but must be careful - May exclude a variable with slightly lower prediction that is easier to forecast
-   Opposite approach of including all variables & removing variables can be a better approach

## Validity of Linear Regression Assumption {.smaller}

-   Regression models are easy to construct & use
-   **However**, underlying assumptions may be wrong
    -   Linearity
    -   No correlations between explanatory variables
-   Residuals are estimates of error in model obtained from subtracting predicted from observed dependent variable values
    -   Residual $e_i = y_{i,observed} – y_{i,predicted}$
    -   Residuals should be normally distributed with constant variance – can plot a histogram to check
    -   Residuals should be uncorrelated with any explanatory variable – can plot residuals vs. explanatory variables

## Histogram of Residuals

![](../images/lecture3/histogram_residuals.png){fig-align="center"}

## Residuals Vs. Explanatory Variables

![](../images/lecture3/residuals_variance.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
![](../images/lecture3/residuals_example.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: column
-   Three variables are defined $X$, $Y$, & $Z$ where $X$ & $Z$ are **explanatory variables** & $Y$ is the **dependent variable**
:::
:::::

## First Model $y = aX + b$ {.smaller}

-   $R^2 = 0.506$ means that we are explaining **50.6%** of the variance in y with the explanatory variables in the model ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_results_1.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="0"} ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_plot.png){.absolute top="200" right="0" width="45%"}

## Analysis of Residuals Vs. X {.smaller}

-   Looks like a constant variance across values of $X$... ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_x_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

## Analysis of Residuals Vs. Z {.smaller}

-   Residuals **not constant** over different values of $Z$ (so we should try to include $Z$ as another explanatory variable) ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_z_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

## Second Model $y = aX bZ + c$ {.smaller}

-   $R^2 = 0.761$ means that we are explaining **76.1%** of the variance in $y$ with the explanatory variables in the model ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_results_2.png){.absolute bottom="0" left="0"}

## Analysis of Residuals Vs. X & Z\$ {.smaller}

-   Now residuals don’t change over different values of X or Z! ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_x_z_1.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"} ![](../images/lecture3/residuals_x_z_2.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

## Dealing With Non-Linear Relationships

![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_plot_1.png){.absolute bottom="150" left="0" width="60%"} ![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_1.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width="25%"}

## Transform the Explanatory Variable (add $x^2$ term)

![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_plot_2.png){.absolute bottom="100" left="0" width="60%"} ![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_2.png){.absolute bottom="50" right="0" width="25%"}

## Other Transformations {.smaller}

-   Log transformation, $x’ = ln(x)$ if effects starts strong at low x but reaches limiting return with further increases in $x$ (often used for income variables)
-   Dummy variables:
    -   $X_1$ = 0 if vehicle ownership = 0 & 1 if vehicle ownership \> 0
    -   $X_2$ = 1 if married & 0 otherwise
-   Variable interactions
    -   $X_1$ = age in years $\times$ income less than \$30k
    -   $X_2$ = age in years $\times$ income \$30k-\$60k
    -   $X_3$ = age in years $\times$ income over \$60k
    -   $X_4$ = gender (male) $\times$ have fulltime job
    -   $X_5$ = gender (male) $\times$ have parttime job

## Non-Linearity in Trip Generation Variables

-   Linear regression assumes each independent variable exerts a **linear influence** on the dependent variable
-   Not easy to detect non-linearity because relationship can appear linear until other variables enter into the model (i.e., it is representing the **effect of multiple variables** with a linear overall effect)
-   **Multivariate graphs** can be helpful to identify non-linearity

## Example

::: {style="font-size: 0.5em;"}
Consider the variables **trips per household** ($Y$), **number of workers** ($𝑋_1$), and **number of vehicles** ($𝑋_2$). Successive steps were performed of a stepwise model estimation. Values (in parenthesis) are t-ratios. In the step 4 model, $Z_1$ takes the value 1 for households with one car and 0 otherwise and $Z_2$ takes the value 1 for households with two or more cars and 0 otherwise. We can see that zero car households will have the value 0 for both $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. Even without the higher $R^2$, the step 4 model would be preferred because it clearly demonstrates there is a **non-linear effect** that’s ignored by $𝑋_2$.
:::

![](../images/lecture3/non_linear_table_3.png){fig-align="right"}

## Variable Selection & Model Building {.smaller}

-   **Problem**: Choose the set of appropriate explanatory variables from a set of candidate variables - **variable selection**
-   Possible approaches
    -   Exploring all possible variables - many combinations
    -   Stepwise regression -\> construct a sequence of regression models by adding or removing variables at each step
        -   **Forward selection**: add variables to the model one at a time until there are no remaining candidate variables that improve fit
        -   **Backward elimination**: begin with all possible variables & remove the least significant variables
-   **Are there problems with these approaches?**

## Variable Specification & Forecasting {.smaller}

-   Consider variables **important for explaining differences** in trip-making decisions
-   **Frequency** & **data plotting** gives idea of variability with respect to different variables
-   Specify variables as per relationship
    -   Continuous
    -   Ordered
    -   Discrete
-   Variable choice depends on availability of observed information & capacity to forecast
-   Statistical significance tests
-   Model goodness of fit can be used to identify impact of specific variables

## Model Validation {.smaller}

-   A good way to validate a model is to compare **observed vs. modeled values** for some groupings of the data
-   Better than comparing totals because **biases may cancel** in that case (high prediction cancels with low prediction)
-   Errors are reasonably low (i.e., less than 30%)
-   Large bias could be addressed by adjusting model parameters, but it’s not easy because there are no clear rules

![](../images/lecture3/validation_table.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

## Model Validation - Learning From Machine Learning

-   Transportation planning field starting to adopt methods from **machine learning** field, including for validation
    -   **Leave-one-out** (LOO) & **k-folds cross-validation** to get mean & std. dev.
    -   **Score** (R2 for linear regression)
    -   **Mean absolute error** (MAE)

## Obtaining Zonal Totals {.smaller}

-   Simple process for zone-based models because already modeling total trips
-   Requires extra step for household-based models – multiplying by number of households
    -   $T_i=H_i(0.91+1.44\bar{X}_{1i}+1.07\bar{X}_{2i}$ where $T_i$ is the total number of HB trips in zone $i$
    -   With dummy variables, we need to know the number of households in each group
    -   $T_i=H_i(0.84+1.41X)+0.75H_{1i}+3.14H_{2i}$ where $H_{1i}$ is the number of one vehicle households & $H_{2i}$ is the number of two vehicle households in zone $i$

## Matching Generations & Attractions {.smaller}

-   Models do not guarantee, by default, that total trips originating in a zone (the origins O_𝑖) at all zones will equal the total trips attracted (the destinations 𝐷_𝑗)

-   Following expression may not hold $$\sum_i O_i=\sum_j D_j$$

-   Generally assumed that trip generation models are **better** than trip attraction models

-   Total trips are then $T=\sum_i O_i$ & a factor applied to trip attraction $$f=T/\sum_j D_j$$

-   This equality is necessary for the next model step: **trip distribution**

## Growth Factor Modeling {.smaller}

-   Growth factor method given by $$T_{i+t}=F_tT_i$$
-   Where $T_i$ is total trips at time $i$, $T_{i+t}$ is total trips at time $i+t$, & $F_i$ is a growth factor. Determining total current trips is a simple process but forecasting future trips (i.e., $F_t$) is a **big challenge**
-   $F_t$ is related to variables such as population ($P$), income ($I$), & car ownership ($C$) $$F_t = \frac{f(P_t,I_t,c_t)}{f(P_i,I_i,c_i)}$$

## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}

Consider a zone with 250 households with vehicles and 250 households without vehicles. Assuming we know the average trip generation rates of each group:

-   Vehicle-owning households produce 6.0 trips/day
-   Non-vehicle-owning households produce 2.5 trips/day

We can determine the current number of trips as $$T_i = 250 \times 2.5 + 250 \times 6.0 = 2125 \text{ trips/day}$$

## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}

-   Let’s assume that all households in the future have a vehicle. We can then estimate a simple multiplicative growth factor as $$F_t = 1/0.5 = 2.0$$ $$T_{i+t} = 2 \times 2125 = 4250 \text{ trips/day}$$

-   Growth factor methods are crude & generally used in practice for **external trips** where additional information is not available

## Growth Factor Example {.smaller}

-   Let us also assume that in the future all households will have a vehicle, but income & population remain unchanged

$$T_i = 6 \times 500 = 3000 \text{ trips/day}$$

-   **But do we expect non-vehicle households to make this many more trips if income is not changing?**

## Stability & Updating Trip Generation Model {.smaller}

-   **Temporal stability**: Population/socio-economic structure changes over time & affects trip rates
-   **Geographic stability**: Trip-making patterns vary from place to place
-   Updating trip generation models
    -   If models were developed using **old data**, it is necessary to update the model for present situation
    -   Best way to re-estimate trip generation model using **present data**
    -   If sufficient data is **not available**, we can update previously estimated model using **small present data sample**

## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}

-   Standard variables are household totals, household size (and structure), number of vehicles owned, & household income
-   **However**, there are many other factors that can be explored regarding household structure
    -   Social circumstances likely affect travel
    -   Personal living alone will have a different set of tradeoffs & coordination patterns than person living in with others
    -   Multi-person household dynamics will vary depending on structure – several students living together may not coordinate trips in same way as a family
    -   Elderly people living with younger people may be more engaged outside the home than those living alone or with similarly aged persons

## Forecasting Variables In Trip Generation Analysis {.smaller}

-   **How do life course events affect trips?**
    -   Appearance of a pre-school children
    -   Time when youngest child reaches school age
    -   Time when youth leaves home & lives alone, with other young adults, or marries
    -   Time when all children of a couple have left home but couple has not retired yet
    -   Time when all members of a household reach retirement age
-   Important factors for identifying/classifying households as being in similar life stage & potentially having more **homogeneous travel patterns**
-   **What about overall aging of population?** Age tends to be associated with decline in mobility in change in lifestyle

## Trip Generation Inelastic In Most Models

-   Independent of the level of service provided in the transport system
-   Probably **unrealistic** but **only recently** techniques have been developed which can take systematic account of these (induced demand) effects

## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}

-   **Trip or journey**: one-way movement from an origin point to a destination point
    -   **Home-based (HB) trip**: trip with the home (or hotel for a nonresident) being either the trip origin or destination
    -   **Non-home-based (NHB) trip**: trip where neither end of the trip is the home
    -   **Trip production**: defined as the home end of an HB trip or as the origin of an NHB
    -   **Trip attraction**: defined as the non-home end of an HB trip or the destination of an NHB
    -   **Trip generation**: total number of trips generated by households in a zone, both HB & NHB

## What is the fundamental event of interest? {.smaller}

-   **Activity**: short stay at a particular location
    -   Usually has a purpose associated to it: work, study, shopping, leisure, etc.
-   **Tour or trip chain**: a sequence of linked trips
-   **Tours** & **activities** correspond more closely with the idea of travel as a derived demand than do the first concepts
    -   Contemporary models are generally interested in **tours** rather than **trips**. **Why?**

## Trip Generation & Accessibility {.smaller}

-   Classical transport planning (4-step) model can incorporate an **iterative process** between distribution & assignment, leaving trip generation unaltered
-   True even in most contemporary models, which attempt to appropriately solve supply-demand equilibrium problem
-   **Disadvantage**: changes to network assumed to have no effect on trip productions & attractions
    -   E.g., Extension of a subway line would not generate more trips between that zone & other zones
    -   May hold for compulsory trips but unlikely to hold for discretionary trips

## Trip Generation & Accessibility {.smaller}

-   Attempts made to incorporate an **accessibility measure** into trip generation by replacing $O_i = f(H_i)$ by $f(H_i,A_i$ where $H_i$ are household characteristics & $A_i$ is an accessibility measure
-   Accessibility generally defined by $A_i = \sum_j f(E_j, C_{ij})$ where $E_j$ is an attraction measure for zone $j$ & $C_{ij}$ is a **generalized cost of travel** between zones $i$ & $j$.
    -   Often give wrong sign or non-significant results due to unresolved model dynamics & problems from using cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data
    -   Leads to **activity-based models** & trip frequency/scheduling choice models (discussed in **CIVE864**)
