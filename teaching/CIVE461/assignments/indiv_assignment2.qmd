Points are assigned both on the correctness of the answer and the completeness of the solution – state all assumptions. Show all calculations and equations. **Do not** use Excel or other software packages.

**Problem 1.** Consider the simple network in the below figure where there are 100 vehicles per hour travelling from A to X and 500 from B to X. The travel time versus flow relationships (volume-delay functions) are depicted in the figure in minutes and the flow v in vehicles per hour.

**a.** Express the objective function of the mathematical program corresponding to Wardrop's user equilibrium in terms of the flows and travel time-flow relationships in the figure. Hint: refer to the Traffic Assignment lecture slides.

**b.** Calculate the equilibrium flows on each link and the travel time for each group of travelers. Calculate the value of the objective function above under equilibrium conditions – i.e., the total expenditure in travel time on the network in veh-hr. You should start with an incremental assignment. You can assume the following loading: 50% A->X, 50% B->X, 50% B->X, 50% A->X. You should then use an all-or-nothing assignment as your second volume in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Perform only one FW iteration. You can use the same FW approximation as in the class example – i.e., evaluate $\lambda$ = 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1.

**c.** Local traffic engineers have decided to install speed restrictions on link C->D so that the new travel time versus flow function is:
t=5.2+0.002v

The total expenditure in travel time (veh-hr) in the system is less than in (b) under these conditions. Why would this be the case? The following two tables show the final Frank-Wolfe flow results for the relationships in part (b) and (c), respectively. Please use these tables in your response.

**Problem 2.** Problem 1 assumes that traffic assignment is deterministic. In reality, traffic assignment (route choice) varies across decision-making motorists on the road. 

**a.** Comment on possible reasons for stochasticity in route choice.

**b.** One way to handle stochastic traffic assignment is via discrete choice models. How might this face a computational challenge? You should support your response with a diagram. Examples and scenarios are also welcome additions.
