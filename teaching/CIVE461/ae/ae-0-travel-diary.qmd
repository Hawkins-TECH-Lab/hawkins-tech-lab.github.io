We will look at the relationship between several different decisions implicit in personal travel.


1. Draw your travel for the day. You should indicate the approximate departure and travel times, mode, and destinations.

2.	Which of these trips are mandatory? Which are discretionary?

3.	Could these trips be made by a different mode (car, taxi, ridehail, transit, scooter, bike, walk) If not, why?

4.	Could you move your home to change the travel time or mode for a trip? Could you perform an activity at home rather than making the trip?
