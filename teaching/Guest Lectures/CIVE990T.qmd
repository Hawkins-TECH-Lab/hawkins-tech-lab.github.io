# Introduction
## Transportation & Land Use

![](./images/transport_activity_systems_land_use.png){fig-align="center"}

## Urban Structure
- Bourne (1982) defines **urban structure** as combination of:
  - **Urban form** - spatial configuration of fixed elements such as buildings, transportation network, & other infrastructure
  - **Urban interactions** - flows of goods, people, information, & money
  - **Organizing principles** - relationshihps between urban form & interactions such as travel cost, social status, & segregation

## Von Th&uuml;nen's Isolated State

## Central Place Theory (CPT) {.smaller}
- Attributed to Christaller (1966) & L&ouml;sch (1954)
- Elements:
  - Single homogeneous good, $g$, is sold
  - Good sold at fixed unit price, $p$
  - Travel possible in any direction at uniform cost, $r$, $/mile
  - Total cost to buyer is good price + transport cost
  $$ C = p + rd$$
  - Stores free to locate anywhere on flat, featureless plane
  - Uniform population density over plane
  - Free market entry/exit
  - Constant production functions (costs) for all firms   

## CPT Demand Function 
![](./images/cpt.png){fig-align="center"}

## Market Area {.smaller}
Given uniform populationd density, $\rho$, and travel in all directions at constant unit cost, one can integrate distance-based demand function to compute total sales at a location.

$$S = \int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi} \int_{x=0}^{D}f(d) \rho dx d\theta$$

For a store to remain in business: $S > S_{min} =$ sales threshold for good $g$

## Multiple Firms & Market Equilibrium
- Given free market entry, firms will continue to enter market as long as $S > S_{min}$
- CPT assumes firms locate to maximize profit
- Firms *pack together* into hexagonal lattice, each generating sales $S_{min}$
- Market equilibrium distribution - also minimizes average travel distance for consumers

## Market Equilibrium Lattice Structure

## Spatial Residential Competition {.smaller}
- Monocentric city model
- Elements:
  - r = commuting distance & residential location on a line or radius
  - z = amount of composite consumption good
  - T(r) = cost of commuting from r to 0 (and back)
  - R(r) = land rental rate at location r
  - s = amount of rented space
  - Y = income
- Fundamental household problem
$$max_{z,s}U(z,s)\text{ such that } z+R(r)s = Y-T(r))$$
- All households have same utility at equilibrium (or would move)

## Bid-Rent Approach {.smaller}
- Rather than solve system, use equal utility assumption to derive *bid-rent* function $\Psi(r,u)$ - maximum willingness-to-pay by household for unit of space at location $r$ given utility level $u$
- Invert budget constraint
$$\Psi(r,u)=max_s \frac{Y-T(r)-z}{s(r,u)} \text{ such that U(z,s) = u}$$
- Equivalently
$$\Psi(r,u)=max_s \frac{Y-T(r)-z(s(r,u),u)}{s(r,u)}$$

## Bid-Rent Approach {.smaller}
- By envelope theorem
$$\frac{\partial\Psi(r,u)}{\partial r}=\frac{T'(r)}{s(r,u)}$$
- Using implicit function theorem on $U(s,z)=u$
$$\frac{\partial z(s,u)}{\partial s}=\frac{-U_s}{U_z}=-\Psi(r,u)$$
- Stochastic bid rent, assuming Type I errors gives
$$Pr(h|r,u)=\frac{exp(\Psi_h(r,u))}{\sum_h^H exp(\Psi_h(r,u))}$$
