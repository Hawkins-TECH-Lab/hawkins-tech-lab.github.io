# Discrete Choice of Choice Bundles

## Discrete Choice: Choice Bundle {.smaller}
::::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
- **Choice bundle**, for example choice of making a shopping trip at a particular location:
    - Choice of making a shopping trip compared with no trip or any other trips.
    - Choosing a mode of travel to reach a destination.
    - Choosing a particular location over other possible locations.
- Different **substitution patterns** may exist in three components of shopping trip choice.
- Overall, a **single discrete choice** but multiple components of choices. 
    - Individual component have no meaning

- Choice of Park & Ride as a mode to make commuting trip:
    - Choice of Park & Ride station location
    - Choice of Park & Ride over all other possible modes, e.g., drive all way, car passenger, transit all way
- Different **substitution patterns** may exist between choices of modes as well as between alternative Park & Ride station locations
- Overall, a **single discrete choice** but **multiple components of choices**
    - Individual component have no meaning

## Modelling Choice Bundles {.smaller}
- We can break the choice components to **capture substitution patterns** that exists at different component levels
- Modelling the choice components
    - **Sequentially** model individual choice components
    - Specifying a **combinatorial space** of choice components and model **simultaneously** as a single discrete choice
    - Modelling as **hierarchical choice** where choice components can be nested within another choice:
        - **More correlated choices** are nested within **less correlated choices**:
        - **Example:** if people are more likely to switch shopping location than travel mode to shopping, location choice is nested within mode choice

## Modelling Choice Bundles {.smaller}
- Breaking the choice components to capture substitution patterns that exist at different component level is a technical approach
- Breaking a choice bundle **does not** define the sequence of choices:
    - Shopping location choice nested within shopping trip mode choice **does not** mean location choice is chosen first then mode is chosen!
    - Nesting is about correlation among choice alternatives

# Sequential Logit Model of Choice Bundle

## Sequential Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
- **Examples:** Mode ($m$) and Destination Choice ($d$):
    - Choose destination
    - Then choose mode, given (**conditional upon**) the destination choice
- Sequentially modelling the choices of alternatives step by step
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture6/sequential_logit.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Sequential Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture6/sequential_logit.svg){fig-align="center"}

$$Pr(d) = \frac{\exp(V_d)}{\sum_{d' \in D} \exp(V_d')} \text{, } Pr(m|d) = \frac{\exp(V_{m|d})}{\sum_{m' \in M} \exp(V_{m'|d})}$$
- Joint probability of choice
$$Pr(md) = \frac{\exp(V_d)}{\sum_{d' \in D} \exp(V_d') \sum_{m' \in M} \exp(V_{m'|d})}$$
$$Pr(md) = \frac{\exp(V_d + V_{m|d})}{\sum_{d' \in D} \exp(V_{d'})} \frac{\exp(V_{m|d})}{\sum_{m' \in M} \exp(V_{m'|d'})}$$

## Sequential Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
- **Conditions are arbitrary:** the estimation process does not allow any verification of the validity of it
- If the actual conditional relationship is opposite to what is assumed in the model, the model will give **wrong forecast**
- Sequential estimation **does not** capture relative difference in substitution patterns between different choice component of  the bundle
- Parameter estimation is **inefficient and biased**

## Estimation: Sequential Logit Model {.smaller}
- Closed form, so classical estimation techniques are feasible: **Maximum Likelihood**
- Likelihood of one observation i for mode choice:
$$𝐿_𝑖=\prod_{𝑚=1}^𝑀(Pr⁡(𝑚_𝑖))^{\delta_𝑚} \text{, } \delta_m = 1 \text{ if the chosen mode is m; 0 otherwise}$$
- Likelihood of one observation i for destination choice:
$$𝐿_𝑖=\prod_{𝑑=1}^𝐷(Pr⁡(𝑑_𝑖))^{\delta_𝑑} \text{, } \delta_d = 1 \text{ if the chosen destination is d; 0 otherwise}$$
- Specification test, statistical significance, goodness-of-fit, elasticity/marginal effect: as explained for MNL.

# Simultaneous Logit Model of Choice Bundle


## Simultaneous Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
- Restructure the **sequential decisions** into a finite number of alternative pairs
- Alternative pairs are **mutually exclusive** and **collectively exhaustive:** single discrete choice case
- The example of mode(m) and destination(d) choice:
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture6/simultaneous_logit1.svg){fig-align="center"}
$$Pr(md) = \frac{\exp(V_d + V_{m|d})}{\sum_{d' \in D}\sum_{m' \in M} \exp(V_{d'} + V_{m'|d'})}$$

## Simultaneous Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
$$Pr⁡(𝑚𝑑)= \frac{\exp(𝑉_𝑑+𝑉_{𝑚|𝑑})}{\sum_{𝑑'^/\in 𝐷}\sum_{𝑚'^/\in 𝑀} \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑑'} +𝑉_{𝑚'|𝑑'})$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑚𝑑)=\frac{\exp(𝑉_𝑑+𝑉_{𝑚|𝑑})}{\sum_{𝑑'^/\in 𝐷} \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑑'}) \sum_{m'^/\in M}\exp(𝑉_{𝑚'|𝑑'})$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑚𝑑)=\frac{\exp(𝑉_𝑑+𝑉_{𝑚|𝑑})}{\sum_{𝑑'^/\in 𝐷} \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑑'} + \ln(\sum_{m'^/\in M}\exp(𝑉_{𝑚'|𝑑'}))$$

## Simultaneous Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
- Deriving marginal choice probability from simultaneous choice probabilities:
$$Pr⁡(𝑑)= \sum_𝑚 Pr⁡(𝑚𝑑)_m = \frac{\sum_𝑚 \exp⁡(𝑉_𝑑+𝑉_{𝑚|𝑑})}{(\sum_{𝑑'^/\in 𝐷} \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑑'}+\ln⁡(\sum_(𝑚' \in 𝑀) \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑚'|𝑑'}))$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑑)=\frac{\sum_𝑚 \exp⁡(𝑉_𝑑+\ln(\sum_{m \in M} \exp(V_{m|d})))}{(\sum_{𝑑'^/\in 𝐷} \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑑'}+\ln⁡(\sum_(𝑚' \in 𝑀) \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑚'|𝑑'}))$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑚)=\sum_{d} Pr(md) = \frac{\sum_d \exp(V_d + V_{m|d})}{\sum_{d' \in D} \exp(V_d + \ln(\sum_{m' \in M} \exp(V_{m'|d'})))}$$

## Simultaneous Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
- Deriving sequential model from the joint model:
$$Pr⁡(𝑚│𝑑)=\frac{Pr⁡(𝑚𝑑)|{(Pr⁡(𝑑)} = \frac{\exp(𝑉_𝑑+𝑉_{𝑚|𝑑})}{\exp(𝑉_{𝑑'})\sum_(𝑚'\in 𝑀) \exp(V_{m'|d'})}$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑚│𝑑) = {\exp(𝑉_(𝑚|𝑑)}{(\sum_{𝑚' \in 𝑀} \exp⁡(𝑉_{𝑚'|𝑑'})}$$
- The simultaneous model captures the influence of lower-level choice in the upper level by adding $\ln(\sum \exp(V_{m|d}))$, 
    - Often called **Inclusive Value** (IV) or **Expected Maximum Utility** (EMU) of lower-level choice
- However, it ignores the **scale difference** (differences in randomness) in two levels

## Simultaneous Logit Model of Choice Bundle {.smaller}
- Unlike sequential model, simultaneous model incorporates expectations of conditional level utility at the conditioning levels:
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture6/simultaneous_logit2.svg){fig-align="center"}
- Systematic utility of destination choice:
$$\tilde{V_d} = V_d + {Expected Maximum Utility of choice of mode}_d$$
- Scale parameters are same (unity) in both levels.

## Estimation: Simultaneous Logit Model {.smaller}
- Closed form, so classical estimation techniques are feasible: Maximum Likelihood
- Likelihood of one observation i:
$$𝐿_𝑖=\prod_{𝑑𝑚=1}^{𝐷𝑀} (Pr⁡(𝑑_𝑖 𝑚_𝑖))^{\delta_{𝑑𝑚}} $$
$$\delta_{𝑑𝑚}=1 \text{𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒 𝑚 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝑖𝑠 𝑐ℎ𝑜s𝑒𝑛, } 0 \text{𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒}$$
- Specification test, statistical significance, goodness-of-fit, elasticity/marginal effect: as explained for MNL.

# Nested Logit Model of Choice Bundle

## Nested Logit Model {.smaller}


## Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
- Conditional choice of mode (m) for a give destination (d): an MNL model:
- The expected maximum utility (EMU) of lower-level choice (m) for a particular upper-level choice alternative (d) is:               
- We can derive the compounded systematic utility of upper-level choices as: 
$$𝑉 ̃_𝑑=𝜇_𝑑 𝑉_𝑑+𝜇_𝑑/𝜇_𝑚  𝑙𝑛(\sum_(𝑚^/\in 𝑀)▒𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝜇_𝑚 𝑉_(𝑚^/ |𝑑) ) )$$
We can define 𝜙=𝜇_𝑑∕𝜇_𝑚  where 𝜙 is known as the inclusive value or logsum parameter.

## Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
- The unconditional probability of an upper-level choice alternative: an MNL
$$$$
$$$$
- Scales should be non-negative: 
- Scale approaching 0 indicates infinite variance, so fully random choice.
- Scale approaching +∞ indicates zero-approaching variances, so deterministic choice.

## Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
- To be a RUM choice model, the scale of the lower-level conditional choices should be higher than the scale of the upper-level choice (the opposite is true for variance)
$$$$
- Both scales are not identified individually, but, normalizing one of them make the other identified.
- Typically, the upper-level scale is normalized to 1.
- 
$$$$

## Estimation: Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
- Closed form, so classical estimation techniques are feasible: e.g., Maximum Likelihood.
- Likelihood of one observation i:
- Specification test, statistical significance, goodness-of-fit: as explained for MNL.
- Testing significance of scale parameter: with 𝜇_𝑑 normalized to 1, 𝜇_𝑚 should be significantly greater than 1. 

## Nested Logit Model: Correlations {.smaller}
- The nesting structure induces a correlations pattern:
- Upper-level choices are IIA, so correlations among unobserved utilities are zero.
- Conditional lower-level choices are IIA (within a nest), so, correlations among unobserved utilities are zero.
- However, as they related to the upper-level choices, nested lower-level choices have a block correlation
- In our case, the (approximate) correlations among the choices of ‘m’ for a particular choice of ‘d’ is:
$$$$

## Nested Logit Model: Elasticities {.smaller}


## Nested Logit Model: Elasticities {.smaller}


## Nested Logit {.smaller}
- Same procedures as MNL are applicable for NL:
    - Goodness-of-fit
    - Specification test
    - Validation
    - Collinearity, budget/income effect.
    - Market segmentation.
    - Aggregating elasticity/marginal effects.
    - Elasticity of attribute of choice alternatives, attributes of choice makers, or categorical variables.
    - Policy evaluations.

## Interpretation of Nesting in NL Model {.smaller}
- Scale is inverse of variance: higher scale means lower randomness (variance) and higher correlations
- If choices of ‘m’ is nested within the choice of ‘d’, it means that choice maker is more likely to switch ‘m’ choices before switching ‘d’ choices
- Block correlations of nested choices explain the strength/patterns of such differential switching between different levels of nested logit model 

##  IID and Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
Consider a route choice problem: In network, multiple alternative routes having common link will have correlated properties.
Example: 2 routes with no partial overlap. Under equilibrium, both have the same average travel time: $$
- Consider: systematic utility of choosing a route: $$
- Logit choice probability: 
$$$$

##  IID and Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
- Add a 3rd route that has partial overlap with route 2.
- Under equilibrium, all have the same average travel time:	
- Consider: systematic utility of choosing a route:
- Logit choice probability: 
- Route 2 and 3 are very similar!

##  IID and Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
- Let us change the utility structure

- Commonalities between 2 and 3 by common w lead to correlation with respect to common ε.
- Further assumption:


##  IID and Nested Logit Model {.smaller}
$$$$
$$$$
- So, the inclusive value of lower-level choice:
$$$$
- Upper-level utility (considering vr =0):
$$$$
- Probability of choosing Route 1:
$$$$

## Nested Logit Model for Single Choice {.smaller}
$$$$

- Nested Logit (NL) model can capture various levels of correlated properties (substitution patterns) among alternatives of a single choice (as opposed to choice bundle) through the nesting structure:
- Within a particular level, alternatives are IIA.
- Between levels, various levels of substitution patterns are captured through nesting structures.

## Generating Function & GEV Model {.smaller}
McFadden (1978). Modelling the Choice of Residential Location," in Spatial Interaction Theory and Planning Models, ed. by Anders Karlqvist, et al. Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing Company, pp. 75-96

- Generating function: A formal power series (polynomial function) that encodes an infinite sequence of 𝑥 (place holder rather than a number) by treating them as the coefficient of the power series: especially powerful for recurring relationships
    - the function may not be a true function and the variables may be intermediate information units
    - Instead of dealing with infinite sequence, generating function gives a single function that encodes the sequence
    - A generating function expresses a sequence (the sequence of coefficients): the 𝑖𝑡ℎ term of the sequence is the coefficient of 𝑥𝑖 in the generating function 

## GEV Generating Function, G(..) {.smaller}
- Define a generating function G(…) for the multivariate joint distribution of random utilities (ε) as
$$$$
- Following properties are key for the G() function:
    1. G(y)≥0 for any argument, 𝑦
    2. G(y) is homogenous of degree D >0. This means 𝐺(𝛼𝑦_1,𝛼𝑦_2,…..,𝛼𝑦_𝐽 )=𝛼^𝐷 𝐺(𝑦_1,𝑦_2,….., 𝑦_𝐽 ) for 𝛼>0
    3. 𝐿𝑖𝑚〗_(𝑦_𝑗→∞)   𝐺(𝑦_1,𝑦_2,….., 𝑦_𝐽 )=+∞ for j=1, 2, 3…..J
    4. Cross partial derivatives exists and are continuous and their signs change in a particular way:  
$$$$

##  Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Model {.smaller}

##  Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Model {.smaller}
- Choice probability of a GEV model based on the GEV generating function (for G(..) of homogenous to degree 1)
$$$$
- The general formulation of Choice Probability of a GEV model based on the GEV generating function
$$$$
- Expected Maximum Utility of the GEV model generated by the G(..) function:
$$$$

## Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Model {.smaller}
$$$$
- GEV mode is the most flexible closed-form model that can capture a wide variety of choice models:
For different generating function, different choice model can arise.
MNL and NL are special cases of the GEV model
- Other GEV models: Network GEV, Cross-nested Logit, Paired-Combinatorial Logit etc. for the G(..) function with degree, 𝜇 

## Estimation: GEV Model {.smaller}
- GEV models are of Closed form and so can be estimated by using the classical estimation technique: Classical Maximum Likelihood 
- However, the conditions on scale (similarity or dissimilarity) parameters needs to be met.

Constrained Maximum Likelihood (CML) method for the GEV model estimation that maintains restrictions on parameter value range while estimating 
- One can use mathematical expressions to ensure such conditions while using classical Maximum Likelihood approach
- Classical Maximum Likelihood is less computationally intensive than the CML
