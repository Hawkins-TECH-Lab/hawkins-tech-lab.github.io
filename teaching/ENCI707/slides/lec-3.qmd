# Crash Course in Statistical Models

## Normal Regression {.smaller}

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j + \epsilon_j; \epsilon_j \text{ is } \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$

- Equivalently $y_i$ is $\sim N(\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j, \sigma^2)$
- Estimation
    - Least-squares: minimize squared residuals
    - Maximum likelihood
    $$L_i = \frac{1}{\sigma}\Phi\left(\frac{y_i-\beta_0-\sum_j \beta_j x_j}{\sigma}\right)$$
- Regression to mean is deterministic for expected value of most regression model expressed as f(covariates)
- Probabilistic application through simulation

## Functions of Random Variables
- From probability theory courses .... transformation of random error term to random variable via Jacobian transformation

## Log-Normal Regression {.smaller}
$$ln(y_i) = \beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j + \epsilon_j; ; \epsilon_j \text{ is } \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$

- Equivalently $ln(y_i)$ is $\sim N(\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j, \sigma^2)$

- Estimation
    - Least-squares: minimize squared residuals
    - Maximum likelihood
    $$L_i = \frac{1}{y_i \sigma}\Phi\left(\frac{ln(y_i)-\beta_0-\sum_j \beta_j x_j}{\sigma}\right)$$
    - $y_i$ must be positive (i.e., non-negative and non-zero)

## Probit Regression {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
$$y_i^* = \beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j + \epsilon_j; \epsilon_j \text{ is } \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$$

- Observed value is **binary** (0/1)
$$Pr(y_i=1) = \pi_i = \Phi \left((\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j)/\sigma \right)$$
$$Pr(y_i=0) = 1 - \pi_i = 1 - \Phi \left((\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j)/\sigma \right) = \Phi \left( - (\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j)/\sigma \right)$$

- Estimation by Maximum likelihood
    $$L_i = \pi_i^{\delta_i}(1-\pi_i)^{1-\delta_i} \text{  }\delta_i=1 \text{, if }y_i=1, 0 \text{ otherwise}$$
    - Variance normalized to 1 (**homogeneous**) or parameterized without a constant (**heterogeneous**)

## Logistic Regression {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Observed value is **binary** (0/1) with $\epsilon_i$ being logistically distributed this time
$$Pr(y_i=1) = \pi_i = \frac{\exp (\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j)}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j)}$$
$$Pr(y_i=0) = 1 - \pi_i = 1 - \pi_i = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j)}$$
- Estimation by Maximum likelihood
    $$L_i = \pi_i^{\delta_i}(1-\pi_i)^{1-\delta_i} \text{  }\delta_i=1 \text{, if }y_i=1, 0 \text{ otherwise}$$
    - Interpretation (scale compounded parameters):
    $$logit(\pi_i) = \text{log of odds ratio} = ln\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right)=\beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_j$$

## Probit/Logistic Regression
- Binary outcome model can be used to model market shares in aggregate demand models
- Pseudo-likelihood function
$$L_i = \pi_i^{y_i}(1-\pi_i)^{1-y_i}$$
- $i$ is the aggregation unit (e.g., zones, groups, etc.)
- $y_i$ is the share (proportion) of $y$ in unit $i$

## Ordered Regression
- We often have ordinal measures for which we cannot assume that the categories are **equally spaced** (if they were then we likely would use linear regression model)
    - Questionnaire items for opinions
    - Data that were originally measured at the interval/ratio level then grouped (lumped) into ordered categories (age, income)
    - Qualitative measures that are not truly continuous
- Ordered regression is a useful tool for above situations

## Ordered Regression
- An important criteria for the ordered probability model is that the **results remain consistent** regardless of how the dependent variable is cut into categories
- This means, if a **new category** is added to an existing variable, the variable’s **coefficients** should remain the same regardless of the number of categories in the dependent variable

## Ordered Regression {.smaller}
- Consider the latent variable model
$$y_i^* = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i$$
$$y_i = j \text{ if } \tau_{j-1} \leq y_i^* \leq \tau_j; j \in \{0,1,2\dots J\}$$
- We have $J$ levels and $(J-1)$ cut points represented by $\tau$. End categories are 0 and $J$ for which values of cut points will be $-\infty$ and $+\infty$, respectively.
- For example, if $J=4$
$$y_i = 1 \text{ if } -\infty < y_i^* < \tau_1$$
$$y_i = 2 \text{ if } \tau_1 \leq y_i^* < \tau_2$$
$$y_i = 3 \text{ if } \tau_2 \leq y_i^* < \tau_3$$
$$y_i = 4 \text{ if } \tau_3 \leq y_i^* < +\infty$$

## Ordered Regression {.smaller}
- Now, if we replace the latent variable by corresponding utility functions
$$Pr(y_i=j|x_i) = Pr(\tau_{j-1} \leq \beta x_i + \epsilon < \tau_j)$$
$$Pr(y_i=j|x_i) = Pr(\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i \leq  \epsilon < \tau_j - \beta x_i)$$
$$Pr(y_i=j|x_i) = \int_{-\infty}^{\tau_j - \beta x_i} f(\epsilon_i) d\epsilon_i - \int_{-\infty}^{\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i} f(\epsilon_i) d\epsilon_i$$
$$Pr(y_i=j|x_i) = F(\tau_j - \beta x_i) - F(\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i)$$

## Ordered Regression {.smaller}
- If we assume $\epsilon_i$ follows a normal distribution with **zero mean** and $\sigma^2$ **variance**, then
    - Ordered Probit Regression
    $$Pr(y_i=j|_i = \Phi((\tau_j - \beta x_i)/\sigma) - \Phi((\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i)/\sigma) $$
    - Typically, set $\sigma=1$
- If we assume $\epsilon_i$ follows a Type I Extreme Value distribution with scale $\mu$
    - Ordered Logit Regression
    $$Pr(y_i=j|x_i) = \frac{\exp(\mu(\tau_j - \beta x_i))}{1 + \exp(\mu(\tau_j - \beta x_i))} - \frac{\exp(\mu(\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i))}{1 + \exp(\mu(\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i))}$$
    - Typically assume $\mu=1$

## Ordered Regression {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Ordered Probit model
$$Pr(y_i=1|x_i) = \Phi(\tau_1 - \beta x_i) - 0$$
$$Pr(y_i=2|x_i) = \Phi(\tau_2 - \beta x_i) - \Phi(\tau_1 - \beta x_i)$$
$$Pr(y_i=3|x_i) = \Phi(\tau_3 - \beta x_i) - \Phi(\tau_2 - \beta x_i)$$
$$Pr(y_i=4|x_i) = 1 - \Phi(\tau_3 - \beta x_i)$$
- Ordered Logit model
$$Pr(y_i=1|x_i) = \exp(\tau_1 - \beta x_i)/(1 + \exp(\tau_1 - \beta x_i)) - 0$$
$$Pr(y_i=2|x_i) = \exp(\tau_2 - \beta x_i)/(1 + \exp(\tau_2 - \beta x_i)) - \exp(\tau_1 - \beta x_i)/(1 + \exp(\tau_1 - \beta x_i))$$
$$Pr(y_i=3|x_i) = \exp(\tau_3 - \beta x_i)/(1 + \exp(\tau_3 - \beta x_i)) - \exp(\tau_2 - \beta x_i)/(1 + \exp(\tau_2 - \beta x_i))$$
$$Pr(y_i=3|x_i) = 1 - \exp(\tau_3 - \beta x_i)/(1 + \exp(\tau_3 - \beta x_i))$$

## Ordered Regression {.smaller}
- Ordered Probit vs Ordered Logit model: Parameters of Probit and Logit are **not comparable**
    - Normal error with unit variance in an Ordered Probit: variance of ordered regression, $\sigma^1=1$
    - Type I Extreme Value has a variance, $\sigma^2=\pi^2/6\mu^2$. So, with a unit scale ($\mu=1$) in an Ordered Logit, the variance $\sigma^2=\pi^2/6$

## Ordered Regression {.smaller}
- Estimation: likelihood function
$$L(y|x,\beta,\theta = \prod_{i=1}^N\prod_{j=1}^J \left(F(\tau_j - \beta x_i) - F(\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i) \right)^{z_{ij}}$$
$$z_{ij}=1 \text{ if } y_i = j$$
$$z_{ij}=0 \text{ otherwise }$$
- Useful to think of $\tau_j$ as **intercepts**
- Standard practice is to think of intercept as **baseline probability** when $x=0$

## Zero-Inflated Ordered Regression {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Observed data have overwhelming portion with zero values: **zero-inflation**
$$y_i = 0 \text{, no further regression model}$$
$$y_i > 0 \text{, } Pr(y_i=j|x)$$
- Estimation: Maximum likelihood
$$y_i=0 -> \eta_i \leq \sum_k \gamma z_k$$
$$y_i > 0, -> \eta_i > \sum_k \gamma_k z_k \text{ & } Pr(y_i=j|x)$$
$$L_i = \Phi(\sum_k \gamma_k z_k)^{y_i=0} \times \left(\Phi(-\sum_k \gamma_k z_k)(F(\tau_j - \beta x_i) - F(\tau_{j-1} - \beta x_i))\right)^{y_i=j}$$
- 2 models: model of **binary** zero/non-zero $y$ & **ordered** regression model

## Count Variable Regression {.smaller}
- Count ($y_i$) of events occuring **randomly** & **uniformly** in tmie with constant expected rate of occurence
$$Pr(y_i) = \frac{\lambda^{y_i}e^{-\lambda}}{y_i!} \text{, } E[y_i] = V[y_i] = \lambda \text{, } \lambda = exp(\sum_j \beta_j x_j)$$
- Likelihood function for estimation
$$L(y_i|x,\beta) = Pr(y_i)$$
- Issues with Poisson model
    - Heterogeneity can violate **constant expected rate assumption**
    - **Upper limit** of count data can exist - can cause violation of $E[y_i] = V[y_i]$ assumption and cause **over/under dispersion**

## Poisson Regression with Heterogeneity {.smaller}
- Existence of over-dispersion requires correction
    - Assume additional gamma heterogeneity
    $$\theta^* = exp(\sum_j \beta_j x_j + u) = exp(\sum_j \beta_j x_j) \times exp(u)$$
    - Consider a positive distribution for $u$, a Gamma distribution with mean 1 and variance $1/\theta=\alpha$
    - Results in a Negative Binomial regression model
    $$Pr(y_i) = \frac{\Gamma(\theta + y_i)}{\Gamma(y_i +1)\Gamma(\theta)}r_i^{y_i}(1-r_i)^{\theta} \text{, } r_i = \frac{exp(\sum_j \beta_j x_j)}{exp(\sum_j \beta_j x_j) + \theta}$$
- Likelihood function for estimation: $L(y_i|x,\beta,\theta) = Pr(y_i)$, $\theta$ is the dispersion parameter, which should be a positive value

## Zero-Inflated Count Regression {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Observed data have overwhelming portion with zero values: **zero-inflation**
$$y_i = 0 \text{no further regression model}$$
$$y_i > 0 \text{, } Pr(y_i=j|x) \text{Poisson or Negative Binomial}$$
- Estimation: Maximum likelihood
$$y_i=0 -> \eta_i \leq \sum_k \gamma z_k$$
$$y_i > 0, -> \eta_i > \sum_k \gamma_k z_k \text{ & } Pr(y_i=j|x)$$
$$L_i = \Phi(\sum_k \gamma_k z_k)^{y_i=0} \times \left(\Phi(-\sum_k \gamma_k z_k)Pr(y_i)\right)^{y_i=j}$$
- 2 models: model of **binary** zero/non-zero $y$ & **count** regression model

## Use  of Econometric Models {.smaller}
- Parameter of explanatory variable makes little sense unless put into context
- Econometric models should be used for:
    - **Prediction** of the dependent variable and/or probability of different values of independent variables
    - **Meaningful interpretation** of estimated model parameters
- Marginal effects (ME)
$$ME = \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} \text{, } ME=\frac{\partial Pr(y_i/U_i/V_i)}{\partial x_j}$$
- Elasticity (E)
$$E = \frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j}\frac{x_j}{y_j} \text{, } ME=\frac{\partial Pr(y_i/U_i/V_i)}{\partial x_j}\frac{x_j}{Pr(y_i/U_i/V_i)}$$

## Practical Significance {.smaller}
- **Marginal effects** and **elasticities** can be challenging to interpret
- **Practical significance** (PS) is an approach to provide a clear illustration of the significance of a variable – sometimes termed **effect size**
- Measured as:
    - **Continuous variables**: % change in $Pr⁡( 𝑉_𝑖)$ for a 1 standard deviation (SD) change in $𝑥_𝑗$
        - Ex. % change in $Pr⁡( 𝑉_𝑖)$ for a 1 SD change in income
    - **Discrete variables**: % change in $Pr⁡( 𝑉_𝑖)$ for presence of variable
        - Ex. % change in $Pr⁡( 𝑉_𝑖)$ given a person is male

# Transportation Demand Models

## Decision Making {.smaller}
- In transportation modeling, analysis deals both directly and  indirectly with decision-making of people and firms
- Decisions can be expressed as elements related to demand and supply
- We define decision as we (**the modeler**) observe it
- Observed decisions can be (or measured as):
    - Continuous type – Example?
    - Discrete type – Example?
    - Ordered type – Example?
    - Count type – Example?

## Complexities of Decision-Making {.smaller}
- Univariate decisions: Example?
- Joint decisions: Examples?
    - Combination of same type of decision
    - Combination of different types of decision
    - Intra-household joint decision
    - Inter-household joint decision
- Issues related to joint decisions:
    - Correlations
    - Endogeneity or self-selection

## Modeling Passenger Travel Demand {.smaller}
- Urban travel demand:
    - Number of trips, types of trips, destination location of trips, mode of trips, routes of trips
- Intercity travel demand: 
    - Cross-boundary trips
    - Intercity trips by bus
    - Intercity trips by rail
    - Intercity trips by plane
- International travel: Air transportation, ferry, ship, etc.
- Tourism Travel: Number of tourists, number of tourists by different modes

## Modelling Passenger Travel Demand
- Modelling multiple dimensions of demand: number of trips, time of trips, mode of trips, etc.
    - Urban Transportation Modeling System (UTMS): trip-based model, activity-based models
- Modeling specific dimension of trips: total trips, transit ridership, etc.
    - Intended to investigate specific **policy impacts**: transit ridership, willingness to pay for better transit, willingness to pay for parking, air passenger demand, tourism demand

## Travel Demand Classifications {.smaller}
- Based on the concept of utility:
    - Direct Utility/ Direct Demand Model
    - Indirect Utility/ Demand Model
- Based on uncertainty in predictions:
    - Deterministic Model
    - Stochastic Model
- Based on maximization approach:
    - Random utility maximization
    - Unconstrained model: Fitting demand function
- Based on level of aggregation:
    - Aggregate demand model
    - Disaggregate demand model

## Travel Demand Classifications {.smaller}
- Aggregate versus disaggregate modeling:
    - Based on different **functional form** and data needs for model estimation, **purpose of study** and **time/money constraints** of the project
    - Disaggregate models are always better than corresponding aggregate ones, if and only if **detailed data** requirements and **computational** burdens are understood
    - In most cases aggregate model can **complement** disaggregate modeling approaches by making the trends better understood

## Aggregate Travel Demand Models
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/model_types.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Linear Demand Model {.smaller}
- Linear Regression
$$\text{Total Demand, D (e.g., number of trips)} = \beta_0 + \beta_n x_j + \epsilon$$

- Elasticity of demand with respect to any variable
$$E = \frac{\partial D/D}{\partial x_j/x_j} = \frac{\partial D}{\partial x_j}\times\frac{x_j}{D}=\frac{\beta_j}{D}x_j$$ 
	
- Elasticity is a function of the value at a data point
- Model estimation: Least-Square
- **Limitations**: Linearity assumption & can result in negative demand

## Cobb-Douglas Demand Model {.smaller}
- Optimum Deand in Cobb-Douglas
$$D_j^* = \frac{I}{p_j}(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}) = \alpha' I^1p_j^{-1}$$

- In absense of budget constraints, the optimum demand function may look similar to Cobb-Douglas direct utility function
$$D_j^* = e^{\alpha_o}I^{\gamma}\prod_k x_k^{\beta_k}\prod_m e^{\beta_m z_m} 
- $x_k$ includes price/cost variable & $z_m$ includes categorical/dummy variables or any other variable that does not have to be log-transformed

## Cobb-Douglas Demand Model {.smaller}
- Stochastic econometric model adds random error ($\epsilon_j$)

$$D_j^* = e^{\alpha_o}I^{\gamma}\prod_k x_k^{\beta_k}\prod_m e^{\beta_m z_m}e^{\epsilon_j}$$ 

- Log-transformation results in a log-linear model
$$ln(D_j^*) = \alpha_0 + \sum_k \beta_k ln(x_k) + \sum_m \beta_m z_m + \epsilon_j$$
- Can accomodate any type of explanatory variables (continuous/categorical)
- **Elasticity**: corresponding parameter - constant elasticity!
$$E=\frac{\partial D}{\partial x_k}\frac{x_k}{D_j} = \beta_j$$

## Translog Demand Model {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Indirect utility (various other forms also possible)
$$ln(V) = \alpha_0 + \sum_i \alpha_i ln(p_i) + \sum_i \sum_{j \ne i} (1/2)\beta_{ij}ln(p_i)ln(p_j) \\ + \sum_i \gamma_i ln(Y_e)ln(p_i) + \gamma_y ln(Y_e)$$
- $p_i$ & $p_j$ are generalized costs for $i$ & $j$
- $Y_e$ is the generalized time-money budget
- **Roy's Identity**
$$D_i = \frac{\partial V / \partial p_i}{\partial V / \partial Y_e} = - \frac{\partial ln(V) / \partial ln(p_i)}{\partial ln(V) / \partial ln(Y_e)}$$
- Resulting optimum demand
$$D_i^* = - \frac{(1/p_i)(\sum_i \alpha_i + \sum_{j \ne i} \beta_{ij}ln(p_j) + \gamma_i Y_e}{(1/Y_e)(\sum_{j \ne i}\gamma_j ln(p_j) + \gamma_y)}$$

## Translog Demand Model {.smaller}
- Empirical model: observed demand ($x_i$) for alternative consumption $i$ follows
    - Lognormal distribution
    - Count variable distribution
    - Other feasible distribution
- Following optimal demand $D_i$ as the latent variable
- $x_i$ follows a parametric distribution with mean value as $D_i$
    - $x_i \sim$ Poisson(mean = $D_i$)
    - $x_i \sim$ Negative Binomial(mean = $D_i$)
    - $x_i \sim$ Lognormal(mean = $D_i$)

- Used TransLog indirect utility and Roy’s identity to model trip generation
- Observed trip generation is considered to follow count variable regression
- Different measures of effective price of making trips and effective budget constraints are tested in two papers

## Translog Demand Model: Example 
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/translog-paper3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Aggregate Logit Model {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Aggregate logit model: model of market shares
$$D_A = \text{Total demand for alternative A}$$
$$D_B = \text{Total demand for alternative B}$$
$$D_C = \text{Total demand for alternative C}$$
$$V_A = \text{Ratio of total demand for A} = D_A/(D_A+D_B+D_C)$$
$$V_B = \text{Ratio of total demand for B} = D_B/(D_A+D_B+D_C)$$
$$V_C = \text{Ratio of total demand for C} = D_C/(D_A+D_B+D_C)$$

- Considering an alternative, $A$, as the reference & using Cobb-Douglas log form
$$ln(V_B/V_A) = \beta_{0BA} + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_{iBA}ln(x_{iB}/x_{iA}) + \sum_{j=1}^n \gamma_{jB}y_j + \epsilon_{BA} \text{ or}$$
$$ln(V_B/V_A) = \beta_{0BA} + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_{iBA}(x_{iB} - x_{iA}) + \sum_{j=1}^n \gamma_{jB}y_j + \epsilon_{BA}$$

## Agregate Logit Model {style="font-size: 0.6em;"}
- Similarly for alternative $C$
$$ln(V_C/V_A) = \beta_{0CA} + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_{iCA}ln(x_{iC}/x_{iA}) + \sum_{j=1}^n \gamma_{jB}y_j + \epsilon_{BA} \text{ or}$$
$$ln(V_B/V_A) = \beta_{0CA} + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_{iBA}(x_{iC} - x_{iA}) + \sum_{j=1}^n \gamma_{jC}y_j + \epsilon_{CA}$$

- Can be estimated as linear regression model for a set of observed shares and corresponding variable values.
- **Issues**:
    -   No underlying behavioural theory
    -   Different elasticity results from different functional forms (ratio or difference of price/cost variable)
