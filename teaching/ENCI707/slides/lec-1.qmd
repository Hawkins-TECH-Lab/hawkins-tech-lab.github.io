# Microeconomic Theory of Demand

## Microeconomics {.smaller}

-   Branch of economics dealing with **behaviour** of **economic agents** including:​
    -   Consumers​
    -   Labour force (workers)​
    -   Firms​
    -   Investors​
    -   Markets: Interactions among all of the above​
-   Demand-Supply:​
    -   **Demand function** representing behavior of users/agents​
    -   **Supply function** representing level-of-service, congestion, & behavior of service providers​
    -   **Market clearance** = demand & supply equilibrium​

## Demand-Supply Relationship

-   **Short-term demand-supply:** Ex. Roadway link at an instant​
-   **Long-term demand-supply:** Ex. Residential housing​
-   Equilibrium

## Shifting Curves

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture1/shifting_curves.svg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Comparative Statics
- Create a model of market behavior:​
  - Explain consumer & firm choices as functions of exogenous variables – e.g., income & government policy​
- Develop scenarios​
  - Changes in exogeneous variables​
- Derive changes in the endogenous variables 

## Comparative Statics Example​
- The market for taxi service:​
  - Supply function: $Q_S$ = – 125 + 125P​
  - Demand function: $Q_D$ = 1000 – 100P​
  - Where does the market clear?​
- What happens if demand shifts such that now $Q_D$ = 1450 – 100P?​

# Quantitative Analysis of Consumer Demand
## Concept of Utility​ {.smaller}
- **Utility**: a measure of *benefit or attractiveness* of alternative courses of action​
  - Assumption that people choose action that **maximizes utility (profit)** and **minimizes disutility (cost)**​
- An abstract/latent concept that gives only **ordinal ranking**:​
  - No inherent meaning​
  - No generic unique function​
  - Unaffected by monotonic transformation​
- Utility measures:​
  - **Direct utility**: f(quantity of consumption)​
  - **Indirect utility**: f(utility of consumption)​

## Consumption Set: Bundle of Choices​
- Derive demand function based on concept of *utility maximization* subject to budget and constraints​
- **Consumption set [X]**: a possible bundle of choices (goods: real or virtual)​
- Consumer has preferences over the consumption set​
- Properties of a consumption bundle (of the mathematical function defining bundle):​
  - Complete, reflexive, transitive, continuous, and convex​

## Properties of a Consumption Bundle​ {.smaller}
- **Completeness**: $A \succsim B \vee A \precsim B$ (weak preference) - You have preferences
- **Reflexivity**: $A \sim A$ - You are indifferent between copies of the same product
- **Transitivity**: $A \succsim B \wedge B \succsim C -> A \succsim C$ - If you prefer A over B and B over C, then you must prefer A over callout
- **Continuity**: Preferences are continuous and can be represented by continuous utility functions
- **Convex**: For x, y, z $\in$ X where $y \succsim x$ and $z \succsim x$ $\forall \theta \in [0,1]$

$\theta y + (1-\theta)z \succsim x$ - For any two bundles that are each viewed as at least as good as a third bundle, a weighted average of the two bundles is viewed as being at least as good as the third bundle

## Utility Function & Consumption Set
- **Utility Function**: Summary of a consumer's behaviour by means of a mathemnatical function
  - A continuous function
  
  $$f(U(x)) \ge f(U(y)) \text{ iff } U(x) \ge U(y)$$

  - Utility is better presented in **ordinal** sense than in **cardinal numbers**

## Utility Function: Diminishing Marginal Utility of Consumption
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture1/utility_function.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Consumption Demand​ {.smaller}
- **Consumers are utility maximizers**: Consumers maximize utility subject to budget/income constraints​
  - Facing prices (p) of goods/services (consumption) and budget constraints (I=income)​
  - Consumer allocates income across goods/services to maximize utility (U)​
- **Marshallian (Uncompensated) Demand**: Demand for items that **maximizes the utility of consumption** subject to a constrained budget​
- **Hicksian (Compensated) Demand**: Demand for items that **minimizes expenditure** to attain a certain (fixed) level of consumption utility

## Demand Functions​ {.smaller}
- Functions explaining quantity demanded as function of price, income (or total available budget), utility, etc.​
  - **Marshallian Demand Function**: Utility maximization subject to optimal allocation of budget to consumption of goods​
    - Uses direct utility function​
    - Concept of production function (for firms)​
  - **Hicksian Demand Function**: Expenditure minimization subject to optimal level of utility of consumption bundle:​
    - Uses indirect utility function​
    - Concept of expenditure function (for firms)

## Indirect Utility and Demand​ {.smaller}
$$V(\mathbf{p},I) = \max U(\mathbf{x}) \text{ such that } \mathbf{px} = I$$

- **Indirect Utility Function**: The function $V(\mathbf{p},I)$ that gives the maximum utility achievable at a given price vector ($\mathbf{p}$) and income $I$ is called the **indirect utility function**
- **Consumption Bundle**: The value of $\mathbf{x}$ that solves the maximization problem is called the **demanded bundle**
- **Demand Function**: The function that connects $\mathbf{p}$ and $I$ is called the **demand function**

## Indirect Utility Function​ {.smaller}
- Often useful to consider utility obtained by a consumer as an **indirect measure** - as a function of prices and income rather than actual consumed quantities
- Assume that $V(p_1,p_2,I)$ is our indirect utility (value) function

$$
\begin{align*}
V(p_1, p_2, I) &= U(x_1^*, x_2^*) \\
                &= U(x_1(p_1, p_2, I), x_2(p_1, p_2, I))
\end{align*}
$$

## Marshallian Demand Function​ {.smaller}
- When the indifference curves are strictly convex, the solution is unique

$$x_1^* = x_1(p_1, p_2, I)$$  
$$x_2^* = x_2(p_1, p_2, I)$$

- If quantity demanded is expressed as a **function of prices and income** (or total available budget), called **Marshallian demand function**

## Definition of Goods​ {.smaller}

:::
:::::

## Definition of Goods
- Income elasticity of demand

$\eta = \frac{dx_1}{dI}\frac{I}{x_1}$

$\frac{dx_1(p_1,p_2,I)}{dI} < 0$ -> Inferior Good $\eta < 0$

$\frac{dx_1(p_1,p_2,I)}{dI} > 0$ -> Normal Good $\eta > 0$

$\frac{dx_1(p_1,p_2,I)}{dI} > \frac{x_1}{I}$ -> Superior Good $\eta > 1$

## Hicksian Demand Function ​{.smaller}
- When indifference curves are strictly convex, the solution is unique where

$$x_1^* = x_1(p_1,p_2,U) \text{ and } x_2^* = x_2(p_1,p_2,U)$$

- If quantity demanded is expressed as a **function of prices and utility**, called **Hicksian demand function**
- Hicksian demand tells us what consumption bundle achieves a **target level of utility** and **minimizes total expenditure**
  - As it is based on **indirect utility**, Hicksian demand is **not directly observable**

## Marshallian & Hicksian Demand​ {.smaller}

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture1/marshallian_hicksian_demand.svg){fig-align="center"}

Can use **Slutsky equation** to obtain an analytic result

$$\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial p_2} = \underset{\text{Substitution Effect}}{\frac{\partial h_1(p_1,p_2,u)}{\partial p_2}} -  \underset{\text{Income Effect}}{\frac{\partial x_1}{\partial I}x_2(p_1,p_2,I)}$$

where

- $h_1(p_1,p_2,U)$ is the Hicksian demand for good 1
- $U = v(p_1,p_2,I)$ is the desired **indirect utility level**
- $x_1(p_1,p_2,I)$ is the Marshallian demand for good 1 (similar for good 2)
:::
:::::

## Indifference Curves​
- Let $U(x_1,x_2,\dots)$ be a twice differentiable utility function. If we increase the quantity of goods, how does the consumer respond?
  - **Indiference curve**: shows combination of commodities for which total utility is constant
  -  Changes in total utility are zero for any change in the consumption bundle on the same indifference curve

## Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)​
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture1/MRS.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Direct Utility Maximization​ {.smaller}
A utility function that is a function of **quantity consumed** (i.e., indifference curves)

$$x^*(\mathbf{p},I)=\max U(x_1,x_2)$$

$$\text{Subject to } p_1x_1+p_2x_2 \le I$$

Using Lagrangian

$$L = U(x_1,x_2) + \lambda(I - p_1x_1 - p_2x_2)$$

First order conditions for optimum consumption

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1} = 0 \text{ and } \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_2} = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_1} = \lambda p_1 \text{ and } \frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_2} = \lambda p_2$$

## Direct Utility Maximization​ {.smaller}
Langrangian Multipler ($\lambda$) can be eliminated by taking a ratio of partial derivatives

$$\frac{\frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_2}}{\frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_1}} = \frac{\lambda p_2}{\lambda p_1} = \frac{p_2}{p_1}$$

- Ratio of price = **Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)** = slope of indifference curve
- $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = I$ is the budget line
- Point of tangency between indifference curve and budget line  = point of optimal consumption

## Envelope Theorem​
- Utility (value) function forms an upper envelope of the graphs of the parameterized family of function ${U(x,\cdot)}_{x \in X}$
- Given an exogenous parameter ($a$) that affects $U(x_1,x_2,a)$, we can obtain the following useful relationship

$$\frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2,a)}{\partial a} = \frac{\partial L(x_1^*,x_2^*,a)}{\partial a}$$

## Marginal Utility of Income (Application of Envelope Theorem)​
- Income is an *exogenous input* from the perspective of optimization

$$\frac{\partial L(x_1^*,x_2^*)}{\partial I} = \frac{\partial U(x_1^*,x_2^*)}{\partial I} = \lambda$$

- $\lambda$ is the **marginal utility of income**

## Indirect Utility Function​ {.smaller}
- Indirect utility optimization is the dual of primal direct utility optimization (**expenditure function**) - minimize expenditure to maintain utility $\bar{U}$
$$V(p_1,p_2,I) = \min_{p_1,p_2} p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 - \lambda (\bar{U} - U(x_1,x_2))$$
$$\text{s.t. } U(x_1,x_2) \ge \bar{U}$$

- Equivalently, by duality (**indirect utility function**) - maximize utility at prices $p_1,p_2$
$$V(p_1,p_2,I) = \max_{p_1,p_2} U(x_1^*,x_2^*) + \lambda (I - p_1x_1 + p_2x_2)$$
$$\text{s.t. } p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 \le I$$

## Properties of Indirect Utility Function​
- **Property 1**: $V(\mathbf{p},I)$ is **non-increasing** in prices $\mathbf{p}$ and **non-decreasing** in income $I$
  - Any increase in prices or decrease in income contracts the affordable set of commodities - nothing new is available to the consumer, so utility cannot increase
- **Property 2**: $V(\mathbf{p},I)$ is **homogeneous degree zero**
  - No change in the affordable set or preferences if both prices and income are increased or decreased by a constant

## Roy’s Identity (Another Application of Envelope Theorem)​
- Connects **Marshallian demand function** and **indirect utility function**
- Similarly, Sheppard's lemma connects **Hicksian demand function** and **expenditure function**

## Roy’s Identity (Another Application of Envelope Theorem)​ {.smaller}
$$V(p_1,p_2,I) = U(x_1^*,x_2^*) + \lambda (I - p_1x_1 - p_2x_2)$$
$$\frac{\partial V(p_1,p_2,I)}{\partial p_1} = - \lambda x_1(p_1,p_2,I)$$
$$\frac{\partial V(p_1,p_2,I)}{\partial I} = \lambda$$
$$x_1(p_1,p_2,I) = - \frac{\frac{\partial V(p_1,p_2,I)}{\partial p_1}}{\frac{\partial V(p_1,p_2,I)}{\partial I}} \text{(direct utility from indirect utility)}$$

# Continuous Demand​
## Functional Forms for Demand/Production/Expenditure​
- Cobb-Douglas function​
- Transcendental logarithm (translog) function​
- Constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function​
- Almost ideal demand system (AIDS)

## Cobb-Douglas Direct Utility Function​
- Simple example
$$\max U(x_1,x_2) = x_1^{\alpha}x_2^{\beta}$$
$$\text{s.t. } p_1x_1+p_2x_2 \le I$$

- Langrangian $L = x_1^{\alpha}x_2^{\beta} + \lambda(I - p_1x_1 - p_2x_2)$

## Cobb-Douglas Direct Utility Function​
- Applying first order conditions (FOC) for optimal utility
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1} = 0 \text{->} \alpha x_1^{\alpha - 1}x_2^{\beta} = \lambda p_1$$
$$\frac{\alpha U}{x_1} - \lambda p_1 = 0 \therefore U = \frac{\lambda p_1x_1}{\alpha}$$
Similarly, 
$$U = \frac{\lambda p_2x_2}{\beta} \therefore x_1 = x_2\frac{\alpha p_2}{\beta p_1}$$

## Cobb-Douglas Direct Utility Function​
- Translating $x_1$ and $x_2$ into the budget equation, the optimal quantity demands (utility maximizing) are
$$x_1^*= \frac{I}{p_1}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}\right) \text{ and } x_2^*= \frac{I}{p_2}\left(\frac{\beta}{\alpha + \beta}\right)$$

- With Cobb-Douglas utility, the consumer spends a fixed proportion of income/budget on each commodity

## Cobb-Douglas Direct Utility Function​
- Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
$$\frac{\frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_1}}{\frac{\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\partial x_2}} = - \frac{x_2}{p_1}\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = - \frac{p_1}{p_2}$$

## Elasticity of Substitution​ {.smaller}
- **MRS**: Measures the slope of the indifference (isoquant) curve
- **Elasticity of substitution ($\sigma$)**: Measures the curvature of the indifference (isoquant) curve
$$\sigma = \frac{\Delta \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1} \right)/\frac{x_2}{x_1}}{\Delta MRS/MRS} = \frac{\partial \left(\frac{x_2}{x_1} \right)}{\partial MRS}\frac{MRS}{\left(x_2/x_1\right)}$$
$$\frac{\partial ln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)}{\partial ln (|MRS|)} \text{(think dln(x)/dx = 1/x and re-arrange)}$$

- Absolute value of MRS to ensure logarithm of non-negative values

## Cobb-Douglas Utility Function​ {.smaller}
- Elasticity of substitution ($\sigma$)
$$|MRS| = \frac{x_2}{x_1}\frac{\alpha}{\beta}$$
$$\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}|MRS|$$
$$ln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right) + ln\left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right) = ln(|MRS|) \text{take derivatives wrt ln(MRS)}$$
$$\sigma = dln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)/ln(|MRS|) = 1 $$
- **Unit elasticity of substitution**: unit curvature of the indifference curve

## Cobb-Douglas Utility Function​ {.smaller}
- Substituting the values of $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$ into the Cobb-Douglas function gives
$$U = \left(\frac{\alpha I}{p_1(\alpha + \beta)}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{\beta I}{p_2(\alpha + \beta)}\right)^{\beta}$$
$$U = U_0 I^{\alpha + \beta}\left(p_1^{-\alpha}+p_2^{-\beta}\right)$$
Where $U_0$ is a constant
- Here U **is not** a function of quantity consumed, therefore can be referred to as an indirect utility function
- One must use **Roy's Identity**

## Roy’s Identity & Cobb-Douglas Function​ {.smaller}
$$U(p_1,p_2,I) = U_0I^{\alpha + \beta}p_1^{-\alpha}p_2^{-\beta}$$
- According to **Roy's Identity**
$$x_1^*(p_1,p_2,I) = \left(\frac{\partial U(p_1,p2_,I)}{\partial p_1} \right)/\left(\frac{\partial U(p_1,p2_,I)}{\partial I} \right)$$
$$\frac{\partial U(p_1,p_2,I)}{\partial p_1} = -\alpha U_0I^{\alpha + \beta}p_1^{-\alpha-1}p_2^{-\beta}$$
$$\frac{\partial U(p_1,p_2,I)}{\partial I} = (\alpha + \beta)U_0I^{\alpha + \beta - 1}p_1^{-\alpha}p_2^{-\beta}$$
$$x_1^*(p_1,p_2,I) = \frac{\alpha I}{p_1 (\alpha + \beta)} \text{(similar result for )} x_2^*(p_1,p_2,I)$$
- If we refer to the previous derivations of $x_1^*$ and $x_2^*$, Roy's identity works!

## Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) Direct Utility Function​ {.smaller}
- General specification: $U = \left(\sum_i \alpha_i x_i^{\rho}\right)^{1/\rho}$
- For an example with two alternatives: $U = \left(\alpha_1 x_1^{\rho} + \alpha_2 x_2^{\rho} \right)^{1/\rho}$
- A flexible function that can represent various forms of indifference curves (demand functions) based on the value of $\rho$

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture1/ces_functions.svg){fig-align="center"}

## CES Direct Utility Function​ {.smaller}
$$MRS = - \frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_2}\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)^{\rho-1}$$
- Elasticity of subsitution
$$ln(|MRS|) = ln\left(\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_2}\right) + (\rho-1)ln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)$$
$$ln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right) = \frac{1}{\rho-1}ln(|MRS|) + \frac{1}{\rho-1}ln\left(\frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1}\right)$$
$$\sigma = \frac{d ln\left(\frac{x_2}{x_1}\right)}{d ln(|MRS|)} = \frac{1}{\rho-1}$$

## CES Direct Utility Maximization​ {.smaller}
- Consider a simple two alternative example
$$U = (\alpha_1 x_1^{\rho} + \alpha_2 x_2^{\rho})^{\frac{1}{\rho}}$$
- Using Lagrangian function and FOC for $x_1$ and $x_2$
$$x_1 = x_2\left(\frac{p_1/\alpha_1}{p_2/\alpha_2}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}} \text{ and } x_2 = x_1\left(\frac{p_2/\alpha_2}{p_1/\alpha_1}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}$$

- Substituting either result into the budget constraint, optimal demands are

$$x_1^* = \frac{I(p_1/\alpha_1)^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}{p_1(\frac{p_1}{\alpha_1})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}+p_2(\frac{p_2}{\alpha_2})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}} \text{ and } x_2^* = \frac{I(p_2/\alpha_2)^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}{p_1(\frac{p_1}{\alpha_1})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}+p_2(\frac{p_2}{\alpha_2})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}$$

## CES Indirect Utility Maximization​ {.smaller}
- For general case, optimal demand is

$$x_j^* = \frac{I(p_j/\alpha_j)^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}{\sum_k p_k (\frac{p_k}{\alpha_k})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}$$

- Indirect utility function at optimal direct utility level
$$V = \left(\sum_k \alpha_k \left(\frac{I(\frac{p_k}{\alpha_k})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}{\sum_k p_k (\frac{p_k}{\alpha_k})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}\right)^{\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}} = \frac{I}{\sum_k p_k (\frac{p_k}{\alpha_k})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}}}\left(\sum_k(\alpha_k^{\frac{1}{\rho}}(\frac{p_k}{\alpha_k})^{\frac{1}{\rho-1}})^{\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}$$

## Translog Demand/Cost Function​ {.smaller}
- **Translog** is a quadratic, logarithmic specification of an indirect utility function written in terms of **expenditure-normalized prices**
  - Normalizing each price by dividing by total expenditure (income) imposes homogeneity
- Logarithmic indirect utility (or cost) function is
$$ln(V) = \alpha_0 + \sum_j \alpha_j ln\left(\frac{p_j}{I}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_j\sum_k \beta_{jk} ln\left(\frac{p_j}{I}\right) ln\left(\frac{p_k}{I}\right)$$
- Optimum quantity demands are derived using a logarthmic version of Roy's Identity

## Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS)​ {.smaller}
- **AIDS** is a combination of **Cobb-Douglas** and **translog** demand functions, describing an expenditure function necessary to attain a specific utility level at a given price
- Typical form is

$$ln(V) = \alpha_0 + \sum_j \alpha_j ln(p_j) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_j \alpha_j ln(p_j) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_j\sum_k \gamma_{jk} ln(p_j) ln(p_k) + \beta_o \prod_j p_k^{\beta_k}$$

# Discrete Demand

## Microeconomic Theory of Discrete Goods​ {.smaller}
The consumer

- Selects the quantities of continuous goods: $Q = (q_1,\dots,q_L)$
- Chooses an alternative in a discrete choice set $i = 1,\dots,j,\dots,J$
- Discrete decision vector $(y_1,\dots,y_J), y_j \in {0,1}, \sum_j y_j = 1$

**Note**

- In theory, an alternative describes the combination of all possible choices made by a consumer
- In practice, the choice set will be restricted for tractability

## Example​
Choices

- Home location: discrete choice
- Car type: discrete choice
- Number of km driven per year: continuous choice

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture1/car_house.png){fig-align="center"}

## Utility Maximization​
$$U(Q,y,\tilde{z}^Ty,\tilde{z}^T,\theta)$$

- Q are quantities of continuous good
- y is the discrete choice
- $\tilde{z}$ are the K attributes of the J discrete alternatives
- $\tilde{z}y$ are the attributes of the chosen alternative
- $\theta$ is a vector of parameters

## Optimization Problem​
$$\max_{Q,y} U(Q,y,\tilde{z}^Ty)$$

Suject to

$$p^T Q + c^T y \le I$$

$$\sum y_j = 1$$

$$y_j \in {0,1} \forall j$$

Why is it impossible to derive a direct demand function?

## Solution to Optimization Problem​
- In a mixed integer programming problem, need to condition on the discrete variables to obtain continuous demand functions​
- Continuous demand functions can be differentiated to obtain optimality conditions​
- Various solution algorithms exist: genetic algorithm, branch and bound, etc.

# Application to Demand Analysis

## Demand Modelling: Application of Utility Theory​ {.smaller}
- Demand models are **descriptive**, not **prescriptive**​
- Observed (revealed or stated) demand used to develop demand models:​
  - Observed demand is optimal demand.​
  - Utility theory used to specify the demand model that is supposed to predict the observed (optimal) demand​
  - Observed information contains measurement (**epistemic**) and random (**aleatoric**) uncertainties, so probability theory must be used to specify a stochastic model​
- **Econometric model**: application of statistics to behavioral/economic data based on a sample of observations​

## Observing/Modelling Demands​ {.smaller}
- Measurement of demands are through specification of random variables​
- Type of demand measurement (variable) defines the nature of corresponding econometric model​
- Underlying theory of microeconomics allows for meaningful interpretation of model parameters and results​
- For example:​
  - Cobb-Douglas theory, CES, translog, AIDS are used in aggregate travel demand models​
  - CES indirect utility specification forms the basis for many discrete choice models (e.g., GEV models), time/resource allocation models, etc.​

## Observing Demands​

## Modelling Infrastructure Demands​ {.smaller}
- **Data** (revealed/stated preferences): data **do not** provide answers themselves​
  - We need **models** and **visualizations** to give context and structure​
- Identify underling **theory** to specify model of interest​
- Two types of models:​
  - **Aggregate** demand models​
  - **Disaggregate** demand/choice models​
- In either case, application of econometric techniques is crucial to ensure **evidence-based analysis**​
- Estimation of appropriate model parameters is the critical roadblock!​
