## Discrete Multinomial Choice {.smaller}
A multinomial choice reduced into an equivalent binary choice problem:

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture5/binary_multi_choice3.svg){.absolute top="150" left="0"}

$$𝑈_𝑗 \ge \max_{j,j' \in C_i, j \neq j'} U_{j'}$$
$$𝑈_𝑗 \ge 𝑈_𝑘 \text{, } k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖$$

- where $C_i$ is the **choice set** of decision maker $i$, $j$ is the **best alternative**, and $k$ is the **second best** alternative

- Probability of choosing alternative j:

$$Pr⁡(𝑗) = Pr⁡((𝑉_𝑗+\epsilon_𝑗) \ge (𝑉_𝑘+\epsilon_𝑘 ))$$
$$Pr⁡( 𝑗)=Pr⁡(\epsilon_𝑘 \leq (𝑉_𝑗−𝑉_𝑘+\epsilon_𝑗 )) \text{ (a CDF function)}$$

## Discrete Multinomial Choice {.smaller}
A multinomial choice reduced into an equivalen
Choice probability in a multinomial choice context:
$$Pr⁡(𝑗)=Pr⁡(\epsilon_𝑘 \leq (𝑉_𝑗−𝑉_𝑘+\epsilon_𝑗 ))$$

Probability distribution of random utility ($\epsilon$) needs to be fully specified to get the unconditional probability:
$$Pr⁡(𝑗)=\int_{\epsilon_𝑗=−\infty}^{+\infty}\int_{\epsilon_𝑘=−\infty}^{𝑉_𝑗−𝑉_𝑘+\epsilon_𝑗} 𝑓(\epsilon_𝑗,\epsilon_𝑘)𝑑 \epsilon_𝑗 𝑑 \epsilon_𝑘$$

  - Specification of univariate distribution, $f(\epsilon_k)$ , and the joint distribution, $f(\epsilon_j,\epsilon_k)$, are necessary
- Possible distributions: 
  - Multivariate normal distribution
  - Type I Extreme Value distribution

## Type I Extreme Value Distribution {.smaller}
- Type I (**Gumbel**) distribution is the most convenient distribution to derive a closed form choice model
  - If \epsilon is Type I Extreme Value (Gumbel) distributed:
$$𝑓(\epsilon)=\mu 𝑒^{−\mu(\epsilon−\eta)} 𝑒^{−𝑒^{−\mu(\epsilon−\eta)}}$$
$$F = e^{-e^{-\mu(\epsilon-\eta)}} \text{, } \mu > 0$$

- $\eta$ is a **location parameter** and $\mu$ is a **positive scale parameter**
- Location parameter is **mode** of distribution
- Scale parameter defines the **dispersion** of the PDF shape

## Type I Extreme Value Distribution
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture5/type1distribution.svg){fig-align="center"}

## Basic Properties of Gumbel distribution {.smaller}
1. The **mode** of the distribution is $\eta$ (the location of peak of the PDF on x axis from zero).
2. The **mean** is ($\eta+\gamma/\mu$), where $\gamma$ = Euler’s constant=0.577.
3. The **variance** is $\pi^2/6\mu^2$.
4. If $\epsilon$ is Gumbel distributed with ($\eta, \mu$), and if $\alpha$ is any positive scalar constant, then ($\alpha \epsilon + V$) is also Gumbel distributed with parameters ($\alpha \eta +V$) and $\mu/\alpha$.
5. If $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ are independent Gumbel variables, then ($\epsilon_1-\epsilon_2$) is **logistically distributed**.
6. If $\epsilon_1$ and \epsilon2 are **Identical and Independent Gumbel variables** with parameters ($\eta_1,\mu$) and ($\eta_2,\mu$) respectively then $\max(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ is also Gumbel distributed with parameters:      
$$\left(\frac{1}{\mu} \ln⁡(𝑒^{\mu\eta_1}+𝑒^{\mu\eta_2 } ),\mu \right)$$

## Basic Properties of Gumbel distribution {.smaller}
7. If $( \epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\epsilon_3,\dots ,\epsilon_n )$ are $n$ independent Gumbel distributed variables with parameters ($\eta_1,\mu), (\eta_2,\mu),\dots (\eta_n,\mu)$ respectively then $\max(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2,\epsilon_3,\dots,\epsilon_n)$ is also Gumbel distributed with parameters (mean, scale): 
$$\left(\frac{1}{\mu} \ln⁡\sum_{𝑗=1}^𝑛 𝑒^{\mu \eta_𝑗}, \mu \right)$$

**Notes:**

- **Homoskedasticity:** Independent Gumbel distributed variables have a common scale parameter, $\mu$. 
- Property 5 is used to derive binomial logit model probability equation.
- Property 7 can be used to derived closed form equation for multinomial logit (MNL) Model.

# Multinomial Logit Model - Scale & Systematic Utility Functions

## Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) {.smaller}
- In case of a multinomial choice situation: Assume random utility ($\epsilon$) is Gumbel distributed with $\eta = 0$ location parameter and a common scale, $\mu$.
- Assume that the utility of the second-best alternative is $U^*$, which is the **maximum of all other alternatives except alternative $j$**, the best one. 
$$𝑈^∗=\max_{k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} (𝑉_𝑘+\epsilon_𝑘 )$$
- According to Property 7, $U^*$ is also Gumbel distributed with parameters (mean, scale)

$$ \left( \frac{1}{\mu} \ln \sum_{k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} e^{\mu V_k}, \mu \right)$$

## Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) {.smaller}
We can write that the second-best alternative is
$$U^∗= V^∗+\epsilon^∗ \text{, } V^* = \frac{1}{\mu} \ln \sum_{k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} e^{\mu V_k}$$		     		
Now for the probability of choosing alternative $j$ (equivalent binary logit form)
$$Pr⁡(𝑗)=Pr⁡\left((𝑉_𝑗+\epsilon_𝑗) \ge \max_{k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} (V_k + \epsilon_k)\right)$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑗)=Pr\left((𝑉_𝑗+\epsilon_𝑗) \ge (𝑉^∗+\epsilon^∗)\right)$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑗)=Pr⁡\left((𝑉^∗+\epsilon^∗)−(𝑉_𝑗+\epsilon_𝑗) \leq 0\right)=Pr\left((\epsilon^∗−\epsilon_𝑗) \leq(𝑉_𝑗−𝑉^∗)\right)$$

## Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) {.smaller}
- According to Property 5, this function is logistically distributed. So

$$Pr⁡( 𝑗)=\frac{1}{1+𝑒^{\mu(𝑉^∗−𝑉_𝑗)}} = \frac{e^{\mu V_j}}{e^{\mu V_j}+𝑒^{\mu(𝑉^∗−𝑉_𝑗)}}$$
$$Pr⁡( 𝑗)=\frac{e^{\mu V_j}}{e^{\mu V_j}+e^{\ln \sum_{k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} e^{\mu V_k}}}= \frac{e^{\mu V_j}}{e^{\mu V_j}+\sum_{k \neq j \text{ & } 𝑗,𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} e^{\mu V_k}}$$
$$Pr⁡(𝑗)=\frac{e^{\mu V_j}}{\sum_{𝑘 \in 𝐶_𝑖} e^{\mu V_k}}$$

- This is well-known Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) - or softmax function in ML!

## Scale of the MNL Model {.smaller}
- Scale ($\mu$) is inversely related to the variance of random error term
- Variance is $\pi^2/6\mu^2$ for a IID Type I extreme value error
- As $\mu -> \infty$, Variance $-> 0$
  - All information are captured by the deterministic component ($V$
  - Choice becomes deterministic (the alternative with maximum V is chosen)
- As $\mu -> 0$, Variance $-> \infty$ & $\exp(\mu V) = 1$ 
  - Alternatives are **equally likely**
  - Choice model does not provide any information
- Constant scale, $\mu$, is **not identified** in an MNL using only one dataset
- Separate scale needs to be specified when fusing multiple datasets

## Systematic Utility Function {.smaller}
Systematic utility function: Linear-in-parameter function
$$𝑉_1=\beta_1+\beta_𝑡 𝑥_{1𝑡}+\beta_{1𝑎} 𝑥_𝑎+\beta_𝑏 𝑥_{1𝑏}^2+\beta_{1𝑎𝑐} 𝑥_𝑎^3+\beta_{1𝑎𝑙}  \ln⁡(𝑥_𝑎)+\dots$$
$$𝑉_2=\beta_2+\beta_𝑡 𝑥_{2𝑡}+\beta_{2𝑎} 𝑥_𝑎+\beta_𝑏 𝑥_{2𝑏}^2+\beta_{2𝑎𝑐} 𝑥_𝑎^3+\beta_{2𝑎𝑙} + \ln⁡(x_a)+\dots$$
$$\vdots$$
$$𝑉_J=\beta_J+\beta_𝑡 𝑥_{J𝑡}+\beta_{J𝑎} 𝑥_𝑎+\beta_𝑏 𝑥_{J𝑏}^2+\beta_{J𝑎𝑐} 𝑥_𝑎^3+\beta_{J𝑎𝑙} + \ln⁡(x_a)+\dots$$

- Alternative Specific Constant - (J-1) are identified
- Permits **non-linear transformed** variables
- Can be **generic** if vary across the alternatives.
- Must be **alternative-specific** if constant across the alternatives (only J-1 are identified)

## Systematic Utility Function {.smaller}
- Systematic utility function: Linear-in-parameter function
$$𝑉_𝑗=\beta_𝑗+\beta_𝑡 𝑥_{𝑗𝑡}+\beta_𝑘 𝑥_{𝑗𝑘}+\dots \text{ (individual variable space)}$$
$$𝑉_𝑗=\beta_𝑗+(\beta_𝑡/\beta_𝑘)𝑥_{𝑗𝑡}+𝑥_{𝑗𝑘}+\dots
\text{ (variable ratio space)}$$
$$
𝑉_𝑗=\beta_𝑗+(\beta_𝑡/\beta_𝑐)𝑥_{𝑗−𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒}+(\beta_𝑟/\beta_𝑐)𝑥_{𝑗−𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦}+𝑥_{𝑗−𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡}+\dots
$$
$$𝑉_𝑗=\beta_𝑗^{'}+\underset{\begin{array}{c} \text{(Willingness-to-pay} \\ \text{for time savings)} \end{array}}{\beta_{𝑡𝑐}}  𝑥_{𝑗−𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒}+\underset{\begin{array}{c} \text{(Willingness-to-pay} \\ \text{for improved reliability)} \end{array}}{\beta_{𝑟𝑐}}  𝑥_{𝑗−𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦}+𝑥_{𝑗−𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡}+\dots
$$

# MNL Estimation & MNL Specification

## Estimation of MNL {.smaller}
- Maximum likelihood estimation:
$$\text{Likelihood function: } 𝐿_𝑖=\prod_{𝑗=1}^𝐽 (Pr⁡( 𝑗))^{𝑦_𝑖}
$$
$$\text{Log-likelihood function: } LL_𝑖=\sum_{𝑗 \in C_i} y_j \ln(Pr⁡( 𝑗))
$$
$$\text{Sample log-likelihood function: } LL=\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{𝑗 \in C_i} y_j \ln(Pr⁡( 𝑗))
$$
- Use **gradient search algorithms**
- Analytical gradient and Hessian functions provide **faster** estimation than numerical gradient and Hessian functions

## Goodness-of-Fit {.smaller}
Model goodness-of-fit is measured by $\rho^2$ value

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture5/gof_LL.svg){.absolute top="150" left="0"}
<br><br><br><br><br>
- $k$ = difference in total number of parameters between two models
$$\rho_0^2 = \frac{LL(\beta) - LL(0)}{LL(*) - LL(0)} = 1 - \frac{LL(\beta)}{LL(0)} \text{, } adj-\rho_0^2 = 1 - \frac{LL(\beta) - k}{LL(0)}$$

$$\rho_C^2 = \frac{LL(\beta) - LL(C)}{LL(*) - LL(C)} = 1 - \frac{LL(\beta)}{LL(C)} \text{, } adj-\rho_C^2 = 1 - \frac{LL(\beta) - k}{LL(C)}$$

- Adjusted $\rho^2$ value 0.3 to 0.5 is considered reasonable (*but depends on model*)
- **Alternative:** Comparing predicted vs. observed shares

## Goodness-of-Fit {.smaller}
- Comparing predicted versus observed share of alternatives:
  - Use **holdout sample** (20%-30% sample unused for estimation):
    - Problematic for small sample size
    - Holding out may distort market sample share of the alternatives and thereby the alternative specific constants
  - Use bootstrap:
    - Generate large number of samples bootstrapped from the same sample
    - Compare under/over predictions

## Validation by Bootstrapping

## Specification Tests
Expected signs of the coefficients
Expected substitution patterns, e.g. value of time savings, etc.
Likelihood ratio test:-2[LL(β)-LL(β/)] is χ2 distributed with k (= number of restricted parameters = the difference between number of parameters of two models) degrees of freedom
Goodness-of-Fit measures: Rho-square, AIC, BIC

## Specification of Logit Model
Logit model works fine if there is no significant random variation of effects of any systematic variables:
Unobserved (random) effects of any variable (varying across the alternatives and/or observations) violates the identical error term distribution assumption!
Example:
Effects of driving cost is influenced by income only: systematic effect and logit model will work fine with cost normalized by income.
Effects of driving cost influenced by income and some unobserved factor, the logit model will be mis-specified.

## Specification of Logit Model
Logit model works fine if choice alternatives are perfectly IIA: proportional substitution exists.
Imperfect competition or correlated variations among subsets of alternatives cause the violation of identical error term distribution assumption!
Example:
People who prefer private car, will prefer taxi more than they prefer transit. So, a logit model that considers all alternative modes are IIA will be mis-specified.

## Collinearity of Independent Variables
If some variables in the model are collinear then  the corresponding parameters can change arbitrarily.
Unstable parameter estimation.
Hessian matrix may not be definite.
It is possible to have correlated variables in the discrete choice model unless they are highly collinear.
For high collinearity, a small changes in model or data causes drastic changes in parameter estimates.
Example: V=βt(Time)+ βc(Cost), if Cost= βb+ βd(Time), then V= (βt + βtβd)Time+ βc βb 
Identification issue.
Solution: Create composite variable using the correlated variables (e.g., cost/time).

## Income/Budget Effects
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/translog-paper3.png){fig-align="center"}

Testing income effects:
Use cost and cost2 as separate variables. 
If cost2 has a statistically significant and reasonable parameter value, income effects need to be addressed.
Addressing income effects:
Income normalization as (Cost/income) or (Income-Cost)
Classifying population into different income categories and develop separate models for each.
Interact income category with other variables.

## Aggregation/Market Segmentation
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/translog-paper3.png){fig-align="center"}

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/translog-paper3.png){fig-align="center"}

## Aggregation/Market Segmentation
![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/translog-paper3.png){fig-align="center"}

Here 60% of vehicle owners are higher income people.
60% of low-income vehicle owners are in white-collar group.
So, we should be careful in categorization at the stage of parameter estimation.


## Aggregation/Market Segmentation
Multicollinearity & correlation among independent (explanatory) variables may affect model predictions.
Appropriate clustering method can be used to derive finite and exhaustive sets of market segments to develop separate models.
Separate model for each market segment can sometimes help capturing heterogeneity in complicated markets.

## Aside: Correlation, Collinearity, & Multicollinearity
Correlation: when an independent variable exhibits a strong linear relationship with the dependent variable.
Collinearity: when two (or more) independent variables exhibit a strong linear relationship. May exist between multiple variables. 
Multicollinearity: Specific case of collinearity between more than two variables.
Collinearity can occur without linear relationship between any two variables.

# Elasticity, Marginal Effect, & Substitution in MNL

## Marginal Effect/Elasticity:  Attributes of Alternatives
Disaggregate Direct elasticity/marginal effect: with respect to an attribute of the same alternative.
$$"Direct ME "=(𝛿 Pr⁡( 𝑗))/(𝛿𝑥_𝑗 )=Pr⁡( 𝑗)(1−Pr⁡( 𝑗)) \beta_(𝑥_𝑗 )$$
$$"Direct E "=  (𝛿 Pr⁡( 𝑗))/(𝛿𝑥_𝑗 )  𝑥_𝑗/(Pr⁡( 𝑗))=𝑥_𝑗 (1−Pr⁡( 𝑗)) \beta_(𝑥_𝑗 )
$$
Disaggregate Cross elasticity/marginal effect: with respect to an attribute of different alternative.

$$"Cross ME "=(𝛿 Pr⁡( 𝑗))/(𝛿𝑥_𝑘 )=−Pr⁡( 𝑗)Pr⁡( 𝑘)\beta_(𝑥_𝑘 )"Cross E "=  (𝛿 Pr⁡( 𝑗))/(𝛿𝑥_𝑘 )  𝑥_𝑘/(Pr⁡( 𝑗))=−Pr⁡( 𝑘)\beta_(𝑥_𝑘 ) 𝑥_𝑘$$

Cross elasticity is the same for all other alternative than alternative k.
This is proportional substitution: an improvement in one alternative, draws proportionately from all other alternatives!


## Fact to check: Attributes of Alternatives
Summation of all probabilities of a choice model = 1
Summation of changes in probabilities (of all alternatives) with respect to a variable (derivative)  = 0.

$$$$

This is true for any discrete choice model and can be used to verify accuracy of elasticity calculation.

## Aggregating Elasticity: Attributes of Alternatives
Disaggregate discrete choice model gives disaggregate values of elasticity for each data point in the sample
Approaches to meaningfully aggregate :
Naïve approach: Consider sample average values of explanatory variables (x) to calculate sample average elasticity
Estimate elasticity for each sample respondent and draw distribution of elasticity values.
Probability weighted sample enumeration (PWSE):

$$𝐸_(𝑥_𝑘)^𝑗=∑_(𝑖=1)^𝑛▒〖(Pr_𝑖⁡( 𝑗))/(∑_(𝑖=1)^𝑛▒〖Pr_𝑖⁡( 𝑗)〗) 𝐸_(𝑥_𝑘)^(Pr_𝑖⁡( 𝑗)) 〗
$$
i is the individual in the sample of size n
j is the specific alternative
x is the variable of elasticity
j=k indicates direct elasticity
j≠k indicates cross-elasticity 
Same approach is application for marginal effect and for  any choice model

## Relationship between elasticity of demand

## Marginal/Elasticity: Attributes of Choice Maker/Choice Context
Such attributes have alternative-specific coefficients: For example, consider income of choice maker
$$$$
Corresponding sum of all alternatives, j ≠ k
$$$$
Rate of change of Pr(j) with respect to income of individual, i:
$$$$

## Marginal/Elasticity: Attributes of Choice Maker/Choice Context
Rate of change of Pr(j) with respect to income:
$$$$

## Marginal/Elasticity: Attributes of Choice Maker/Choice Context
$$$$

## Aggregating Elasticity: Attributes of Choice Maker/Choice Context
Use similar approach of aggregating market share from disaggregate choice model predictions:
Microsimulation
Sample enumeration
Classification with naïve aggregation
Naïve aggregation

Same approach is application for marginal effect and for  any choice model


## Marginal/Elasticity of Categorical Variables
Choice elasticity with respect to categorical variable is tricky.
“1% change in choice probability with respect to 1% change in a categorical variable, e.g. presence/absence of parking spot at destination” has little meaning!
Arc-elasticity is the best way: Express the change in choice probability for the presence/absence of the categorical variable.

$$$$

Arc-elasticity can also be used for continuous variables.


## Proportional Substitution
Proportional substitution: an improvement in one alternative, draws proportionately from all other alternatives!

![](../../../assets/images/teaching/ENCI707/Lecture3/translog-paper3.png){fig-align="center"}

In reality: Small gasoline car share should be drawn more than that of Large gasoline car!
Proportional substitution: This will draw shares from large and small gasoline car proportionately.


## IIA: Independent and Irrelevant Alternatives
$$$$

This property is derived from assumption: the random utilities,\epsilon are independent and identical in distribution.

Random error are identically distributed, having same scale or variance.

$$$$

## IIA: Independent and Irrelevant Alternatives
Example of blue bus/red bus: If real alternatives are not following IIA, then MNL would induce serious error.
Previous: P(car)=1/2 and P(Blue bus)=1/2
Now a new Red bus is introduced and under the IIA assumption that the ratio of choice probabilities between car and Blue bus must be constant, so P(car)=1/3, P(Blue bus)=1/3 and P(Red bus)=1/3, which is unrealistic.
Actual will be P(car)=1/2, P(Blue bus)=1/4 and P(Red bus)=1/4; but now the ratio of car and Blue bus is not the same as was before introducing Red bus.

## IIA: Independent and Irrelevant Alternatives
Three alternatives with same utilities 1: car, 2: Blue bus and 3: Red bus and (V1=V2=V3=V) 
Now probability of choosing 1: car would be compared against the second highest attractive alternative (U*)
$$𝑈^∗=\max⁡( 𝑈_2,𝑈_3)=𝑉^∗+\epsilon^∗
$$
As per Gumbel distribution with 0 mean and unit scale
$$𝑉^∗=\ln⁡( 𝑒^(𝑉_2 )+𝑒^(𝑉_3 ))=\ln⁡( 2𝑒^𝑉)=\ln⁡( 2)+𝑉
$$
This step assumed that the random errors of alternative 2(Blue bus) and 3(Red bus) are independent and in such case, probability of choosing car:
$$𝑃(𝑐𝑎𝑟)=1/(1+𝑒^(𝑉^∗−𝑉_1 ) )=1/(1+𝑒^(𝑉+\ln⁡2−𝑉) )=1/(1+2)=1/3
$$

## IIA: Independent and Irrelevant Alternatives
Actually, 2(Blue bus) and 3(Red bus) are perfectly correlated and in that case the maximum utility of 2 and 3 are simply (V+\epsilon) that means V*=V
$$𝑃(𝑐𝑎𝑟)=1/(1+𝑒^(𝑉^∗−𝑉_1 ) )=1/(1+𝑒^(𝑉−𝑉) )=1/(1+1)=1/2
$$
That means IID assumption makes V* too high by an amount of \ln2. 
IIA is attributed to disaggregate/individual choice situations, not the overall market share.

## IIA Violation Test
We can always test IIA by developing alternative nested logit models.
It is also possible to test statistically whether IIA is violated or not without developing nested logit models.

Steps for testing IIA:
Estimate the base MNL  model for the full set of alternatives and refer to its parameters as βC.    
Remove one or more alternatives with suspected IIA violation problem to make the constrained choice set C/.
This will reduce the number of parameters in the new model and its parameter set is then βC/. 
In each case, in addition to estimating the parameter sets we also produce variance covariance matrices , ∑, (Inverse of Hessian Matrix) of the estimated parameters sets.

## IIA Violation Test
 	
Let use refer to the corresponding matrices as ∑βC and ∑βC/ of the full model and the restricted model, respectively.
If the alternatives in the choice set  satisfy IIA then the two variance-covariance matrices will have the same values for corresponding cells: ∑βC = ∑βC/    
Let us consider the Null Hypothesis, H0: βC = βC/   
Conduct tests:
Hausman and McFadden Test
Small and Haiso Test

## IIA Violation Test
Hausman and McFadden Test (Econometrica, 1984):
(\beta ̂_(𝐶^/ )−\beta ̂_𝐶 )^𝑇 (Σ_(\beta ̂_(𝐶^/ ) )−Σ_(\beta ̂_𝐶 ) )^(−1) (\beta ̂_(𝐶^/ )−\beta ̂_𝐶 )
This is χ2 distributed degrees of freedom equal to the number of alternatives removed in the restricted model.

Small and Haiso Test (International Economic Review, 1985)
Conduct likelihood ratio test between base model and the restricted model
$$−2(𝐿𝐿_(\beta ̂_𝐶^/ )−𝐿𝐿_(\beta ̂_𝐶 ) )$$

This likelihood ratio is χ2 distributed degrees of freedom equal to the number of alternatives removed in the restricted model. 

# Policy Evaluation Using MNL

## Policy Evaluations
Elasticity:
Direct elasticity
Cross elasticity

Consumer surplus & social welfare analysis
Marginal rate of substitution between two variables (ratio of corresponding parameters) in the choice model:
Value of Travel Time Savings (VOTTS) in mode choice.
Willingness to pay for improved transit reliability in transit choice.
Willingness to pay for transit accessibility in home location choice. 

## Willingness-to-pay Analysis
Systematic utility function needs to have cost as a variable (p) along with another variable of interest x.

Assumption: Any changes in x is balanced by changes in p to maintain same level of utility: total utility does not change. 

Using First order Taylor’s Expansion:

After transposing (assuming overall utility change is zero):

## Willingness-to-pay Analysis
For linear-in-parameter utility function

Willing-to-pay for any continuous variable change

Value of Travel Time Savings (VOTS): additional amount of money to reduce 1 unit of time

Value of Reliability (VOR) or Safety (VOS) : additional amount of money to increase 1 level of reliability(r), safety(s)

## Consumer Surplus

## Consumer Surplus
For Changes in only one (independent) alternative (j):

## Welfare Analysis

# Forecasting & Prediction Using Disaggregate Choice Models

## Applying Disaggregate Model for Forecasting

## Applying Disaggregate Choice Model for Forecasting
We do aggregate forecasts, so why do we need disaggregate models?
Aggregation suppresses information  misleading information after data aggregation (i.e., Simpson’s Paradox & Ecological Fallacy)
Statistical inefficiency of aggregate approach
Although we aggregate the forecast, we can explicitly capture information at individual level
We can track many sensitive policy issues
Aggregation of forecast is possible at any level we want, as the model is disaggregate
Sometimes modelling at disaggregate level makes the model independent of artificial zonal structures and the model may be transferrable

# Sampling & Discrete Choice Models

## Sampling
Sampling of choice makers from population using RP or SP survey:
Exogenous Sample: Sample share of alternatives are: 
Identical to those of population shares if representative.
Not-identical if not representative.
Endogenous/Choice-based Sample: Respondents are sampled based on observed choices.
Sample share of alternatives are different from those of population shares.
Sampling of choice alternatives: irrespective of sampling of respondents:
Choice alternatives are collectively exhaustive.
When choice alternative space is large, then sample alternatives.

## Sampling of Choice Makers
Exogenous sampling of choice makers (Stratified Random Sampling) 
Population size, N.
Stratification of population into total G groups.
Share (%) individual in a particular group, g in population, Wg.
Sample size, n.
Share (%) individual in the particular group, g in sample, wg.
Probability of an individual being selected in the sample,   


Sampling probability is not a function of parameter, β.

## Sampling of Choice Makers
Exogenous sampling of choice makers (Simple Random Sampling)
Probability of an individual being selected in the sample,  

Sampling probability is not a function of parameter, β.

For representative exogenous sample (stratified/simple random sampling) no correction to choice model estimates is needed.
For non-representative sample, parameters except the Alternative Specific Constants (ASC) do not require correction.
ASC needs to corrected/updated to match actual market share.

## Sampling of Choice Makers
Endogenous/Choice-based sampling of choice makers (randomly select choice makers of specific choices).
Selection of respondent of specific choice maker group (e.g. transit users, driver, bicyclists) still should be random in some way.
Choice model with choice-based sample produces unbiased estimates of all parameters except the Alternative Specific Constants (ASC)
ASCs need to corrected/updated to match actual market share.

## Sampling of alternatives: Large Choice Set
Large number of alternatives (e.g. destination location choice model), a random sample of alternatives can be used to estimate the model

## Sampling of alternatives: Large Choice Set

## Sampling of alternatives: Large Choice Set

## Managing Large Choice Sets
Reducing alternatives:
Use various feasibility constraints to reduce number of alternatives.
Random sampling from large choice set.
Wrong choice set may generate distorted predictions.
